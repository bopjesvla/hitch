            <description>Hitched many times from this spot. If you go to Puerto Natales, wait for a direct ride._ because if not, it is not fun to stay in the middile of the pampa where the wind is very strong and cars go fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;― (Hitchwiki), March 2017&lt;hr&gt;Take a Collectivo 15 to Tres Puentes (any cab with Tres Puentes or Zona Franca), the port (it costs 450 Pesos, less than a USD or Euro).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then walk on the Ruta 9. It&amp;#x27;s by far not the best spot, but after a while you will manage to get a car to the police post or even to the bigger West/East road split. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You might pay the Collectivo Taxi driver a bit more (like 1000 Pesos) to get you further. Tres Puentes is the last stop of the taxi, so it shouldn&amp;#x27;t be a big deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s plenty of place to stop, but cars are quick, why I wouldn&amp;#x27;t necessarily walk further (unlikely to reach a calmer spot on foot).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2016</description>

            <description>Good spot south... got lucky because the very was closed earlier so there was a long line of cars waiting to cross. I just started walking and got picked up half an our later&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2017&lt;hr&gt;Worked for me great to get South. I waited a bit longer, spotting only Argentinian cars since I had to go to Ushuaia. Be selective if you want to go on long rides. I do not recommend getting on a truck here...some km after the ferry port you will hit 100 km gravel road on the Chilean side of Tierra del Fuego, basically until the border in San Sebastian. So you would go with something like 20/30 km/h. Cars drive something like 60, sometimes 80, if you get a crazy driver. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Mrm1985 (Hitchwiki), March 2016&lt;hr&gt;supposedly good place to hitchhike toward Rio Gallego or El Turbio/Punta Arenas/ Tierra del Fuego.

            <description>Let&amp;#x27;s be clear: anything on this road will be tricky. It&amp;#x27;s mostly local traffic. Only option: walk as far as you can, passing the big Carrefour and the bus terminal (maybe you can bribe the driver to bring you to the police post?). Took me four hours to get to the police post, but then no problem at all into any direction I wanted. You could try to write a big banner saying: bring me to the police post or so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Mrm1985 (Hitchwiki), March 2016&lt;hr&gt;it might look sensible place to El Calafate (there are trucks coming out petrol station on the near parallel road), but people running in that area are not used to hitchhiker and we got few unfriendly middle fingers in a couple of hours... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2016</description>

            <description>Guer Aike could be your spot if you need to go north from Rio Gallegos or if you came from the west (El Calafate, Rio Turbio). I&amp;#x27;d recommend you wait at the police station; those guys actually tried to help me. I, stubbornly, walked through a huge construction site (Dec 09) and got lost in a maze of intersections, before I stumbled upon the right road by sheer luck and finally managed to thumb a ride on the roadside after an ordeal of several hours. Again, stay at the police post, you might also be able to talk to queing drivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Alright. We need to talk about this place, because you will eventually end up here, if you are heading North to South on the 40. One thing first: Most cars will head to the coast since they try to bypass the 100 km gravel road towards Tres Lagos. When I arrived I met another hitchhiker who already waited two days to get to Chalten and then decided to take the bus. I waited here from 12 pm til 8 pm, then headed to the free Municipal Camping. Next day from 5 am til 2pm no ride to Tres Lagos: Many cars stopped and told me they only went up to the estancia, but no way would continue on the 40. Eventually I gave up El Chalten and took a ride to Gallegos. It&amp;#x27;s a 400 km way, but you can get dropped of at the police post there and take the 5 towards El Calafate (another 300 km). That went incredibly quick. In Rio Gallegos I immediately got a car to Rio Turbio where I headed instead (El Calafate should be similarly easy). I know...it&amp;#x27;s 700 km, but better to drive for 6 or 7 hours than spending two days at this spot. If someone of you get&amp;#x27;s to this place...can you send me a picture of my nice poetry work on the Tres Lagos sign (obviously I almost went insane there :DDDD)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2016</description>

            <description>It took me 3 days hitching to get out of this villag!. Further up the carreterra austral there is a ferry connection; check the timing of the last ferry because no-one will leave that way after 30 mins or so before the last ferry departs (which was 3pm several years ago).Traffic is incredibly thin, but that one car that does appear may very well take you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2012</description>

            <description>Got a lift super quick in the direction of Cromwell, but only as far as Luggate. Driver explained that maybe 30% of traffic from here was going to Cromwell/Alexandra, but from Luggate about 90% of traffic is going that way. The spot itself is ok with a little road entrance for drivers to pull over. We walked to this spot as there was roadworks at the 84/6 junction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 5 min, ride: 12 km ↘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―luckyluke, January 2024</description>

            <description>Good hitching going north (on the northern side) from here as i found that the extended low speed zone with reasonable through traffic made it easy to get a ride. Took me three mins to get a car to Christchurch from here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2015</description>

            <description>Heading south on the 6, we thought we&amp;#x27;d try our luck for a while hitching from outside the church. There wasn&amp;#x27;t really much traffic at all and most signalled to us that they were turning left up to the glacier. Better off walking to the other side of the bridge and hitching after the glacier junction. 2/5 as it is definitely still possible to catch a ride going further south.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―luckyluke, January 2024</description>

            <description>pretty poor spot to get caught out at! There was plenty of traffic but there is a big blind corner limited space for drivers to stop and they are usually pacing it here. Having said that, I was able to get a ride from here within 45 minutes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

            <description>to get to Punta Ninfas and see the elephant seals. Three cars passed in two hours. One of them was going only half way to an estancia. On a weekend some locals seem to drive there to have a bbq. It might be a better idea to share a rental car with other people. The gravel road is bad, but doable in a normal car, unless it has been raining very heavily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2013</description>

            <description>&amp;quot;Just after the bridge is the best spot!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;- Unknown driver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, the sight is beautiful, cars see you from distance, they can pull over easily, but definitely a mediocre experience. Drivers make encouraging signs and smiles but did not stop, however, I think it was just our exceptional bad luck of the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

            <description>Oh, random A3...&lt;br&gt;This is a good spot at first sight: lot of space to park, good visibility, petrol station on the other side of the road, BUT : the petrol station is almost not used at all, and though friendly, drivers don&amp;#x27;t stop.

            <description>Fairly long wait heading to Hokitika, but worth mentioning this was around 2 hours before sunset and we were still well and truly within Greymouth where a lot of traffic was clearly just travelling locally. We eventually found a ride from a fella heading to Christchurch, and we rode with him to Kumara junction just 16km south on the 6. I imagine this spot is a lot better earlier in the day. Use of a sign recommended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 60 min, ride: 19 km ↙&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―luckyluke, January 2024</description>

Plenty of room to pull over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 15 min, ride: 43 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―luckyluke, January 2024</description>

            <description>Pretty sure every hitch-hiker travelling between Launie and Hobart ended up there at some point. Space for cars to pull over, petrol stations with a lot of clients: it&amp;#x27;s been a really good spot for me, both ways. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

            <description>Easy easy! All drivers go to Perth which is a very good spot for Hobart (or Launie). Though a bit desolated, this bit of road has all you need: space for drivers to pull over, traffic and not too much speed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

            <description>If you&amp;#x27;re going to the west coast this road looks like an enticing shortcut vs going via Nelson. Indeed, someone used the exact words, &amp;quot;enticing shortcut&amp;quot; and took me from the perfect hitch spot outside the supermarket to here. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;5 hours later:
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;There was tons of traffic, they could see me, there was space to pull over. Nobody stopped. Nobody was going to the west coast this way, everyone is just going to work in the vineyards and farms a few miles down the road, and they won&amp;#x27;t help A hitchiker.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I was told this by a guy who saw me waiting there 4 hous ago, and felt bad enough to drive me back to the Nelson road during his lunchbreak, the spot i was at in the first place, where I caught a ride in 5 minutes. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;This road has AIDS, its quicker via Nelson. Don&amp;#x27;t bother unless you are genuinely happy to wait around for hours on end for nothing, and at best get dropped in the middle of knowhere.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m not the only person who&amp;#x27;s had issues with this road, it&amp;#x27;s not a shortcut, its a trap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5, wait: 300 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Gsbdb266, January 2024</description>

            <description>Heading towards St Arnaud, we walked up and down this road searching for ample space for cars to stop - only the odd junction to a farm or yard. It is possible to hitch this road to St Arnaud, but most cars are only travelling to local vineyards. The nice fella that eventually took us to St Arnaud had to turn around further up and come back round for us. Be prepared for a long wait with no shade on a sunny day. Bring lots of water!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5, wait: 120 min, ride: 108 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―luckyluke, January 2024</description>

            <description>Plenty of traffic, but we waited a little while before getting a lift out of town. Most traffic heading further will be heading north towards Havelock/Nelson after Renwick, and a lot of the ferry traffic heading that way likely takes the 62 bypassing Blenheim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 20 min, ride: 11 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―luckyluke, January 2024</description>

            <description>To go to Hobart?&lt;br&gt;BAD spot. In my experience, leaving Launceston is not really an easy task. There is to much traffic and/or no space for drivers to pull over until... the highway. Well, this is not a very good option, try something else and don&amp;#x27;t lose hope: made it to Hobart in very decent time every time I tried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

            <description>Nice spot to hitch, lots of traffic (heavily dependent on ferry schedule). Found a lift to Blenheim in just a couple of minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 5 min, ride: 29 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―luckyluke, January 2024&lt;hr&gt;Despite the constant flow of traffic and the ideal straight open road it was difficult to find a ride! After about an hour and a half I got a ride well beyond my destination (Kaikoura) to Lyttleton!!&lt;br&gt;I suspect the reason it took so long to get a ride may have been that the competition curekids was running saw 56 groups of hitchers make their way from Picton to Christchurch that morning!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

            <description>Not the best place to hitchhike but probably your best bet if you want to get out of town. It is directly on the highway. There is some place for car to pull out but nothing awesome. Don&amp;#x27;t try to walk further to find a better place, nothing better ahead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2013</description>

            <description>Enough space for someone to pull over. After the turning for Whakapapa Village so you miss anyone not going south, but catch anyone coming from there. It&amp;#x27;s before the 100kph sign so they&amp;#x27;re not necessarily going fast either. People pulling into the fuel station also have a chance to see you&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 5 min, ride: 165 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―NatPark2, January 2024</description>

            <description>We experienced a fairly long wait time here. There was a fair amount of traffic, for a relatively quiet road, as well as space to pull over (albeit a bit short). We were here at 8AM and it was raining pretty heavily. We went to the petrol station to put some extra layers on and without even attempting to hitch we were told by the staff there that we were not allowed to solicit rides on their property. Found a lift to Ohakune after 90 minutes or so, as we decided our best bet to get to Wellington would be back on Route 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 90 min, ride: 34 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―luckyluke, January 2024</description>

            <description>Great spot, but hard to reach! The spot itself is super efficient to hitch hike north on road 151 (to Mendoza, and before to San Rafael). If you stay on road 51 it is really easy to go far, huge traffic and lot of trucks and lot of space for car to stops :)
&lt;br&gt;To reach it : in 2023 take the colectivos línea 2 from Centro of Neuquén, and take one that goes to Centenario (not all buses of línea 2 are going there). Ask the driver to leave you at a stop where you can take another bus that will take you to Vista Alegre Norte. Then it is one of the last stops, and 20mns of walk. Count 1h30 at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 30 min, ride: 520 km ↑&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―losangelitos, June 2023</description>

It was awesome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2012</description>

            <description>No luck - super quiet road, my guess is most of the cars we saw were only travelling short distances out of town. If you are trying to get to Tongariro National Park, just stick to Route 1 and head down to Tūrangi instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―luckyluke, January 2024</description>

            <description>You could ask drivers filling up with petrol at this Caltex servo but its not very busy here, so its quicker to hitch directly on the highway, traffic goes under 80kph here so its pretty safe and easy to get a lift going further east.  And theres heaps of space for cars to pull over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2016</description>

            <description>Warrigal Rd on-ramp.  There is a little space for cars to pull over just at the start of the on ramp.&lt;br&gt;There is a lot of local traffic here, but if you wait long enough it should be a good spot to go further east.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2016</description>

            <description>Not such a great spot to get out of Melbourne. I picked this place because it had a decent onramp and was close to the metro. Don&amp;#x27;t accept ride offers to Werribee (as I did), as most exits don&amp;#x27;t have a corresponding onramp and you will either be walking a ways or hitching on the motorway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2012</description>

            <description>Ask Drivers stopped at the red light if they are going east on the monash freeway.  It may take a while to get a ride leaving melbourne from here, but you should at least be able to get a ride to another on ramp further down the Monash Freeway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2016</description>

            <description>Not the greatest place for hitchhiking, but doable... &lt;br&gt;You won&amp;#x27;t be getting a long-distance ride, a short ride to a better HH-spot is more likely - the traffic is all &amp;#x27;local&amp;#x27; here!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the freeway onramp, but there&amp;#x27;s enough space for standing without passing the &amp;#x27;freeway entrance&amp;#x27; sign and therefore breaking the law.&lt;br&gt;The cars are coming around the bend with low speed so drivers have time to spot you despite the bend.&lt;br&gt;The road is wide enough for cars to pull over without obstructing the traffic. (But the emergency lane starts some 100metres further down the road...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weekday + 4pm + sign &amp;#x27;ANYWHERE BUT HERE&amp;#x27; (+ being a girl) was the combination that got me a ride to the ringroad in 10 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS. There&amp;#x27;s a much busier(traffic from the CBD) onramp across the street.&lt;br&gt;Might get a ride quicker, but it might not be so safe...

            <description>Nice wide shoulder, near a roundabout so the cars are going slow. Hitch from underneath the 100km speed sign. 6.5/10 visibility though, because drivers are just coming out of a turn. Still works great.

We moved ~30 kilometers and then on the highway it was super easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 5 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―wolczeski, November 2023&lt;hr&gt;I actually left a comment for the spot just north of here, but this is the location that I left from. I stood behind the road fences on the grass to avoid any encounters with the police. I stood with a sign that read &amp;#x27;Syd&amp;#x27; and I was picked up within 10 minutes by a kayaker on his way to Wangaratta, which is where I was dropped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I left here on a wet Saturday morning at 09:00 after catching a train out to Cragieburn. If I hitch north again, I&amp;#x27;ll leave from here, and if I ever leave Melbourne by car, I&amp;#x27;ll be sure to pass this spot for future hitchhikers!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>Decent spot for heading south towards Hamilton/Wellington. Lots of space to pull over. Found a ride to Hamilton after 20-30 minutes - most traffic is going straight under the motorway on the 22 but decent amount of cars going south on the 1. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 30 min, ride: 105 km ↘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―luckyluke, December 2023</description>

            <description>On ramp here onto the Princes Hwy. Anywhere along this HWY is fine, plenty of space to pull over. I went from Syd to Melb this way once and its absolutely beautiful scenery but slightly longer waits, less traffic, and cars are only going 30-60k down the road, sometimes less. Beautiful though! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

There is also a bus station, and a supermarket, empanaderia across the street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2015</description>

            <description>Probably better to go a bit down the road to the other spot, but roadworks forced me to find a different place to hitch a ride. Pretty decent area. Lots of cars, but two directions so a sign would make it easier for people to gauge when to stop. You&amp;#x27;re visible from the entire roundabout, two Kiwis came from the other way and turned around to give me a lift. Good a place as any, definitely gets you hitched&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 30 min, ride: 45 km ↑&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2023</description>

            <description>This is a service station just past Glenrowan and before Wangaratta. I was dropped here on my way to Sydney.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was really wet, so it was difficult to get around to people and ask for a lift, so I waited for people to walk through and pay for their fuel. The third person I asked gave me a lift to Albury. In hindsight I would wait for a lift to a farther destination, as I had trouble finding a lift from Albury. All in all, a good spot when you&amp;#x27;re already on the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>Hitch spot 100m before the onramp to the Hume Fwy heading south towards Melbourne.  There is plenty of room for cars to stop, but traffic can move fast here so there is less time for people to stop.  A lot of traffic continues towards Wangaratta, but it is possible to get a lift from here direct to Melbourne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2016</description>

            <description>I was dropped here by my driver, and waited over an hour asking people for a lift, but only local traffic was passing. I ended up leaving this place once the rain stopped and found a lift closer to the on-ramp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would go to the spot on the on-ramp in the future.

            <description>horrible spot, the cars can see you but there&amp;#x27;s nowhere they can really pull over. Locals advise hitching at the lights so people can pull into the road at the cemetery, but its inconvenient. there&amp;#x27;s a petrol station just up the road, but it has traffic from both directions. Dont bother walking south, the speed limit goes up and theres nowhere at all for cars to stop. Try walking a bit furth back into town and there may be somewhere better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>nowhere for cars to pull over on the length of highway heading out of batemans bay, so try to avoid this area completely. locals recommend hitching at the traffic lights near the cemetery, as cars can pull over there, but its inconvenient for drivers.

            <description>This is the last town that the Hume passes through on its way to Sydney. Sadly that won&amp;#x27;t be for much longer (August 2013). People may break here, and it&amp;#x27;s not a huge detour. Ii found a lift to Canberra in around 5 minutes.

            <description>Easy to get to from the city center as opposed to the south exit. The northern exit is also easy to get to, just ask around for busses.&lt;br&gt;There is a steep roadside where you can put your backpack and it is in the shade during the afternoon. A panaderia is on this side of the road.&lt;br&gt;The acceleration lane could be a place where cars can stop to pick you up, trucks probably not.&lt;br&gt;Worth to try in order to get outside of the city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2015</description>

            <description>I left here on a Sunday morning with the intention to bypass Sydney. I stood with a sign that said &amp;#x27;Syd&amp;#x27; on it just to get going. There is a turning lane just after this spot that cars can pull in to, but the traffic starts to speed up after the lights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I waited here for over 30min until someone stopped. I&amp;#x27;d suggest waiting before the lights, or asking people at the Caltex Service Station. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>This is a really good place to hitch! Get off the bus right after the toll gates and hitch from the bus stop. Bus fare 42 pesos (May 2014).

There you can take the bus 711 (wich costed 40 uruguayos on octobre 2013) until &amp;quot;Peaje de Remanso de Neptunia&amp;quot;, you walk a few meters after the toll and rise your thomb!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2013</description>

            <description>Peaje pro Interbalneario:  From Montevideo catch bus number 700 which brings you directly to this place (the last stop!). It is perfect to go to Punta del Este or Cabo Polonio, Punta del Diablo ect. If you wanna go to Punta del Diablo or Cabo Polonio ect. and they can&amp;#x27;t carry you the whole way I recommend you to make sure they go for Route 9 (San Carlos, Rocha ect..) There is a lot more traffic and chances a quite high somebody will pick you up. In general the weekend works way better, but if you are not in a hurry other days should work to. Mornings and evenings work better than midday/afternoon. And like everywhere: chances are better for women... Route 10 is probably nicer and could work in summer, but we didn&amp;#x27;t try. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2012</description>

            <description>This looks like the place I was dropped at just before my driver turned off for Wollongong. I recommend anyone attempting to bypass Sydney from Melbourne to get dropped here and look for a lift. The third driver I asked was going to Newcastle, and eradicated the Sydney headache. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a great place to rest/camp and approach drivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>I&amp;#x27;m not completly sure about the spot,  but I guess this is the place we hitchhiked from. It&amp;#x27;s a good place especially coming from Valizas or Aguas Dulces to get a lift on the highway 9 for example to Montevideo. Cars can stop very well on the hard shoulder but there is not much traffic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2013</description>

The cars come up the hill slowly and the drivers will see you from a distance, which is good since place to stop is not abundant once they are past you.

Great spot, just was there to early, but waited 45mins. Not to much. Plenty o space for cars to stop before pulling in the motorway&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2015</description>

            <description>Buin is reached by the micro from La Cisterna Metro station for 1500CLP with blue micro, ask around for right direction, metro station has few exits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However Shell in Buin is inside the town so you get mostly local cars.  Yellow line you see is a shoulder road separated from autopista by fence and is a bit senseless.

If that has been the case with you, I&amp;#x27;d recommend writing on a paper the name of one of these places  on the way: Mangueiras or Quatro irmãos. These are some sort of farms on the way, there&amp;#x27;s absolutely nothing around these farms, but trucks come in and out loading stuff produced by in the region.

            <description>Hitched from Ravensthorpe to Albany in one go this summer. Got a ride in under 15 minutes.

            <description>If it is often long waiting times til we hitch a ride from Chuí towards Pelotas. If that has been the case with you, I&amp;#x27;d recommend writing on a paper the name of one of these places  on the way: Mangueiras or Quatro irmãos. These are some sort of farms on the way, there&amp;#x27;s absolutely nothing around these farms, but trucks come in and out loading stuff produced by in the region. This can be a way of moving some kilometers if you are stuck, since truck drivers might want to pick you up thinking that you&amp;#x27;re coming to work on those places or something like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2019&lt;hr&gt;The entrance to Santa Victoria do Palmar is a good spot to hitch hike, cars and trucks go slowly, mostly to Porto Alegre, Pelotas or Rio Grande. It&amp;#x27;s very easy to hitch hike from Chui to here, and from here to the rest of the cities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2013</description>

            <description>I think here is another option to get out of Santiago. Go to central bus station and take really cheap bus to Llaillay there is another peage post with less cars. There is more quiet and easier to catch a ride.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Dzeikobas (Hitchwiki), January 2014&lt;hr&gt;If you are traveling South outside of Santiago on Rout 5 (Pan American Highway) this is a perfect place as this is the entrance of the city. And it is very easy to get there - you just have to take mentro to Vespucio Norte, cross the big road and take the bus 305 (or better ask also at the bus driver if he is going there), take off before the huge intersection (aprox 7 minutes of the ride) and walk some 5 minutes to the spot. There is also a troll station, so the cars go slowly. It is really easy!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>its true!!! Best hitching spot in the damn world. In the dark, in the rain, still always &amp;lt;5 min. Cars all go straight to Santiago, highway curves here at the Copec station so everyone sees you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Kait~ (Hitchwiki), November 2015&lt;hr&gt;Doesn&amp;#x27;t get any better than this.  The highway starts here so every car is taking it.  But it&amp;#x27;s still walking distance from the city center.  I got a ride in less than five minutes- best hitchhiking spot I&amp;#x27;ve ever seen in the world.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Dr.Keith (Hitchwiki), June 2014&lt;hr&gt;South or southeast towards Santiago or Rancagua.

It&amp;#x27;s fucking hard to hitchhike from the Zarate junction to Campana (which is on the way to Buenos Aires), it&amp;#x27;s better to stay a little more here and keep trying to find someone who can take you a longer way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2013</description>

            <description>All directions, either south to Santiago, north to La Serena or east towards Mendoza in Argentina. Emergency lane at the entrance to the motorway. You can get nearby by micros (mini buses) from Valparaiso or Via del Mar. Ask for the ones going to Quilpue as they all pass near Jumbo Hipermarket in Via. Get off near Puente Lusitania, cross the bridge and turn east. Another option is metro to the station Chorillos (electronic card needed, no single tickets).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2013</description>

O fluxo nao  intenso, mas a quantidade que para  maior... Aprox. umas 10h sai com duas amigas pra pegar carona: elas para Mendoza e eu para o Chile. No primeiro levantar de dedos, elas conseguiram carona com um caminhao e eu, depois de meia hora, consegui com uma familia...direto para Santiago. O unico ponto  que pode ser um problema  a fronteira ARG-CHI, que nao pode ser atravessada a p.

            <description>Spot is okay, people goes a bit too fast but long road and place to stop for cars. Reachable in bus, line 611 i believe, to El Borbollon. There is a gas station also near. Mendoza is hard to get out from, i think here you are pretty sure to leave. Not a lot of camions though&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 60 min, ride: 109 km ↑&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―losangelitos, June 2023</description>

            <description>Traffic is going pretty quick, but I awkwardly camped here overnight. There is a horse training facility nearby. You can jump the fence and camp there for flatter ground, but you&amp;#x27;ll probably be spotted in the morning, as the riders are up at dawn. They called out hello to me!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of leaving, someone pulled out of the service station to pick me up. I waited around 10-15 minutes. I didn&amp;#x27;t bother asking people at the service station, but that would have worked had it been later in the day with more traffic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

Catch road trains to Darwin and Perth, or the other way to Sydney, Adelaide, etc. If going North or West, don&amp;#x27;t settle for anything less than a ride all the way to where you are going.

            <description>Heading out to cross the Nullarbor, this BP station is strategically the best spot to look for a lift. Unfortunately, the roadhouse owner is one of the biggest pricks one can meet in Australia and will promptly kick you off the property (and then yell at you for an additional 5 minutes). It&amp;#x27;s best to avoid the property itself and stand adjacent to it, or you may get the cops called on you. Should the owner decide to bother you anyhow, there&amp;#x27;s no use reasoning with him, so just tell him to lick a camel&amp;#x27;s ass. Anyone planning to cross the Nullarbor should also note that the Ceduna IGA is the last reasonably priced grocery store that you will find for a long, long time, so stock up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2012</description>

            <description>In theory this is a good spot since there is a service station, but for some reason it does not receive much of the traffic. I stood here for around an hour on the on-ramp, as I didn&amp;#x27;t think it was wise to hitch on the motorway. There looked to be a camping area around 500m up the road, but you can only get to it by walking on the motorway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you can avoid this spot I would. If you are coming from the south and your driver gets off here, then get dropped off at the earlier town: Coolongolook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>You could probably walk to the on-ramp, but there wasn&amp;#x27;t a clear pathway there, so I opted for the service station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I arrived I was behind another hitchhiker. He left within 15min of me arriving. It took me another 45min to get a lift, but I said no to two lifts, as I wanted a longer distance ride. I ended up finding a ride all the way to Coffs Harbour for the night. Camped with my drivers and was dropped off at Ballina the following day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This service station services traffic in both directions, so it would make sense to have a sign that reads the direction you wish to travel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The roadside garbage collectors walked past me and told me they see hitchhikers here all the time, so it&amp;#x27;s a popular drop off point!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>If heading westward, do yourself a favor and turn down the ride offer to Penong. The same traffic will be passing through Ceduna, where there is a grocery, relatively inexpensive (for rural Australia, anyway) bottle shop, and a nice beach. Penong has none of these things, and both the petrol station and general store are very expensive. (The flies are horrible and there&amp;#x27;s hardly any shade, either.) If you are stuck here, camping spots aren&amp;#x27;t hard to find, and the pub is a friendly place to relax after a day of hitchhiking failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2012</description>

            <description>We first tried to hitchhike to go southwards from a gas station inside the city (Ancap) but almost all drivers were returning to the city or heading north. We got a ride from there to a point outside of the city (about 5km) where many trucks stop. There were dozens of them parked on the left side of the road when going south. We waited less than a minute until the first truck went out of that parking and picked us up!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2015</description>

            <description>Smaller petrol station. During lunchtime, big traffic in both directions (Santa Fe or Crdoba). Ask people where they are going. &lt;br&gt;In the afternoon, traffic is scarce, in the direction of Crdoba it is better to stand on the other side of the road with a sign (very important, use a sign) and wait for drivers coming from the road opposite from the station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2015</description>

            <description>I hitchhiked in a police station and a restaurant here with a friend (we&amp;#x27;re 2 guys). Thought it would be hard because it was almost 8pm (on the summer, so we still had sun shining), but soon a truck driver and a car driver which stopped at the restaurant offered us a ride to south. We guess the truck driver was going straight to Montevideo, but we choose the car driver which took us to Carmelo, next to Colonia del Sacramiento.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2013</description>

People said it&amp;#x27;s comun to see people hitchhiking there. When we were walking and hitchhiking in the same time going to this place, someone stopped and took us to the aduana (customhouse) which I guess all the trucks getting to Uruguay have to stop to check their documentation. There we spent 20minutes untill a truck stopped and we asked the brazilian driver to take us. He took us to Minas de Corrales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2013</description>

            <description>Try this point. Just 3 blocks away from the main town square. Cars reduce velocity in this point and it&amp;#x27;s also one entrance from the route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2014</description>

            <description>Hitching south/east: There is a big BP Truck Stop here, on the Kambalda turnoff from the roundabout.

            <description>Hitching West towards Perth: this spot is walkable from town, and this street becomes the highway you follow to Perth.  Between Lionel St and Throssel St there is parking by the side of the road where cars can pull over, you can get a lift at least to the edge of town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>South-bound hitch spot on the highway.  THis spot is just south of the traffic lights with Boundary street, and has lots of room for cars to pull over.  Traffic is slow here on its way out of Macksville, so its easy for cars to stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its a good spot to stop and dumpster dive the nearby Woolies supermarket on your way south.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only downside to this spot is that it is popular with truckies to stop and rest here.  If the trucks wont take you you might have to wait for them to leave so that there is enough room for cars to see you and stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2016</description>

The best day is saturday cause many people are going back to their home after a work week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get to this point, we took a bus to near Guaba (R$ 7 - 2016) and they left us after the police station, in front of the gas station, where there is a bus stop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2016</description>

            <description>Daqui voc pode pegar carona tanto pro oeste do Rio Grande do Sul, quanto para o sul do estado. Se voc vai pro Uruguay sem uma cidade especfica como destino, voc pode fazer uma placa simplesmente com o nome &amp;quot;URUGUAY&amp;quot;, porque da vc pode conseguir uma carona (assim como eu consegui) que te leve at a fronteira no oeste do pas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMO CHEGAR AQUI?&lt;br&gt;- Pegar o nibus que vai pra Guaba (custou r$7,50 em jan/2013, mas talvez existissem opes mais baratas, no pesquisei muito)&lt;br&gt;- Pedir pra descer no ponto de nibus logo depois do pedgio e do Posto da Polcia Rodoviria (marcado no mapa). &lt;br&gt;- V pra sado do posto de gasolina que est a do lado do posto policial. Se estiver ruim, voc pode voltar at o pedgio e tentar carona l. No posto policial  eles vieram dizer pra gente que no se pode pedir carona.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2013</description>

            <description>There place is one of the majors exits of the city, where many drivers go to take the Highway BR-290 to West or East, or the Highway BR-116 to North.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best place to ask a ride is in front of the Continental Hotel because it is between two traffic lights and the drivers go slowly and they can stop for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2014</description>

I did it in october 2013, on my way to Santa Catarina.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOW TO GET THERE?&lt;br&gt;You go to the Terminal Rodoviaria do Camelao, in Porto Alegre, and take the bus to de &amp;quot;Pedagio Gravata&amp;quot;, it costed $7 reales when I did it. There you walk a few meters and stand on the road side. I waited for 10 minutes only!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2013</description>

            <description>I was heading north to Byron Bay on the Pacific Highway when I decided that i&amp;#x27;d make a detour for Nimbin. I decided to get out and walk here to wait for a ride to Lismore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Walk past the merging lanes so the drivers to freak out about colliding with other cars. Once I did that and had my sign with &amp;#x27;Lis&amp;#x27; on it, I found a ride within 5 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;d only stop here if you&amp;#x27;re coming up from the south and don&amp;#x27;t want to go into Ballina / Byron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>This was quite possibly the quickest ride I ever procured. As soon as a I set my bags down and reached for my sign after leaving my last driver, another car tooted their horn at me and once I showed him my sign he agreed to take me to Byron Bay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that it&amp;#x27;s real common for people to hitchhike around here. This was a good spot to get to Byron, but the road can be a little tricky, so do it in daytime or with a super chilled driver not in a rush!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>I went to Posto Catarinão and talked to some workers and truck drivers about a ride to Porto Alegre (south). Very difficult to get a ride going South. After that, I waited on the hard shouder for 40 min (maybe more), so I decided to walk 4 km to South until PRF (Polícia Rodoviária Federal) station. After 10 min waiting, I got a ride straight to Porto Alegre. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Chlange25 (Hitchwiki), January 2015&lt;hr&gt;Posto Catarino. You can get here by public bus from Terminal Centro in Florianpolis (the end of platform C). Good spot for hitching south to Porto Alegre. Ask around or hitch on the merge lane of the entrance to the motorway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2014</description>

People think it&amp;#x27;s a good spot, but they had bad experiences so they don&amp;#x27;t allow hitch hiker to stay there. It&amp;#x27;s not longer a good point to hitch hike. If you happen to be there, the best option is going to Biguacu and walked down the road a few blocks, until you cross a bridge over a river. It&amp;#x27;s not the best option, but I hitch hiked there to Sao Paulo in 10 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2013</description>

            <description>Not a bad spot (for going north) if you cant get out further towards the airport. Most ppl wont be going far, but should get you out of town a bit. Inner City Bypass just turns into a main road, which will then take you to the onramp onto the Bruce Highway (north) and the airport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

Didn&amp;#x27;t take 5minutes to truck stop for us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOW TO GET IN THIS SPOT:&lt;br&gt;- Take a bus to the Boqueiro bus station&lt;br&gt;- Take a bus to Central bus station of So Jos dos Pinhais&lt;br&gt;- Take the bus to Jardim Carmen (maybe the bus going to So Marcos also can take you somewhere next to here)&lt;br&gt;- Ask to get off in front of the Cupim 2 gas station&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOMEONE WHO HITCHHIKED HERE?&lt;br&gt;- Yep, I tried to share some information about this trip.

&lt;br&gt;Arrived here already at night, tried to hitchhike the trucks but most of them were going south. Still there were some going North, but I was not lucky.
&lt;br&gt;After more than one hour, a family going to Rockhampton picked me up and drove me all the way to there.

            <description>No se puede cruzar a pie. Un policía muy amable me consiguió una carona con un coche que iba pasando.

            <description>If you&amp;#x27;re willing to go to Tofo but got stuck in Inhambane, don&amp;#x27;t pay to the taxi drivers that offer to take you there. They will surely ripp you off. Instead, just walk to the beggining of N242 (you&amp;#x27;ll see a high cellphone tower). You&amp;#x27;ll get a hike easily from here.

You can get here by bus 001 or 340 to Itapecerica da Serra getting off at Praa Belchior de Pontes and from there taking bus 030 to Jaquitiba. Another option is bus 282 from Terminal Tiet, but the last one leaves at 6 pm and 4 pm on weekends.

            <description>Good visibility. Layby for driver&amp;#x27;s to pull over. Beside a picnic bench and table and under a tree for some shade from the heat. It took us 40 minutes to get a ride south from this spot. The one downside is drivers that are stopping may also be going to the airport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2016</description>

            <description>Good spot on the edge of town. Every car going north from Alice will pass here. Vehicles tend to be a bit fast but there is plenty of space for them to stop and visibilty is good. Downside of the spot is that it is hard to reach (abot 60 min by foot from city) and it provides little shade. So go early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2016</description>

            <description>CEASA: There&amp;#x27;s a train (CPTM - ESMERALDA LINE) that takes you here easily. You have to take the YELLOW LINE of the METRO and then do the combination. Get down in CEASA station. (In every station you can ask for a map of lines). Here is not the best option for those who want a fast ride. Take your time, be amazed with this huge (HUGE!!) space full of truckers, fruits, greens, fish, and lots of other foods and talk with EVERYONE. When I say everyone, i mean EVERYONE (not only truckers). Say them where you want to go, ask if they know where people who go that way, usually park their vehicles or in which tent inside CEASA they have their lunch. People who works here knows lots of people, and if they like you, chances are HIGHER for you to find a trucker going to RIO, CURITIBA, PORTO ALEGRE, CHILE, PARAGUAY, ARGENTINA, MANAUS, PORTO VELHO. EVERYWHERE! Truckers here can go everywhere!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I tryed to hitch a ride from here, I was looking for Rio de Janeiro, I couldn&amp;#x27;t find anyone going there in that day (only in the next one) but I received offers of truckers who were going to LOTS of other places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>Good spot to catch a ride west on the Tanami road but you&amp;#x27;ll have to get a lift to get here. There is not much traffic but vehicles will pull in slowly and are generally very likely to stop. Most cars will take you to Yuendumu. Best days are Sunday and early Monday as people drive back into communities from town. There is not much shade and a slight chance to get stranded for a night in the desert if you arrive too late. Take plenty of water. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2016</description>

FAROL IS THE BEST OPTION! REALLY! It could be the best option, because it&amp;#x27;s full of truckers, but the guys who work there DOES NOT let HITCHHIKERS TALK WITH THE TRUCKERS. They will tell you that you can only ask for a ride OUTSIDE the station. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―The-mente (Hitchwiki), July 2013&lt;hr&gt;POSTO FAROL&lt;br&gt;The good old way to hitchhike. Talking with the truck drivers is always a gooid option. And this is the place to do this when leaving So Paulo this way, Lots of truckers stop here before hitting the long road. Just talk with them. Be friendly and everything  will be alright. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To reach here, get down on ARMENIA metro station and take the bus GUARULHOS VIA DUTRA. Ask for the bus driver to tell you, get down on the Policia Rodoviria Federal and walk to the autostation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>There is a gas station. It is not very big, but you can definitely get a ride till the next bigger one.&lt;br&gt;It is easy to get there with a bus, it takes, however, a lot of time (around an hour ride).&lt;br&gt;Bus 1783-10 you can take from the metro L1 Santana station, it departs every 20 minutes. Bus 2023-10 departs from the same metro line L1, but three stations further north, Tucuruvi. Check google maps to be sure where to take the bus, and if the route still exists. Ask the driver for Rodoviaria Ferno Dias_ it is the motorway going direction Belo Horizonte. The busses bring you very close to the motorway, and then you have 3 minutes walk till the gas station. You will have to cross the motorway over the bridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There you can ask drivers. There are very few cars going to Minas Gerais, but a lot of those driving at least till Atibaia. Before the cross with rodoviaria Dom Pedro I there comes a Petrobras gas station with &amp;quot;Frango Asado&amp;quot; restaurant. There is more traffic, and lots of people travelling to Minas Gerais stop to eat there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

            <description>A good spot to go north direction Brasilia. From Sao Paulo take the purple line metro from Estacao da Luz until the very end. There&amp;#x27;s a moment somewhere during the trip when you have to change the train, the one continuing all the way to Jundiai is on the same platform, on the track just next to the one with the train you came with. From the final station, walk along Avenida Marginal which continues into Av. Prefeito Luis Latorre. You&amp;#x27;ll see the signs for the highway. Took us around 10 minutes to get a ride to Campinas just before the sunset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2014</description>

            <description>Good place to go from Rio. Here are speed cameras, so cars go slowly. Went from here to Paraty and waited near 15-20 min.&lt;br&gt;To get here:&lt;br&gt;1. Take train from Central to Campo Grande&lt;br&gt;2. Then you need bus to Mangaratiba. Ask people, if possible. It goes not from Rodoviaria, but also near station. Yoou need go right and a bit forward from train station. Costs ~10$R&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2016</description>

            <description>Going to Sao Paulo, you can stand in the road where the Don Pedro II crossis a urban avenue. Many cars take the avenue, so in that point you meet directly with cars and trucks going to Sao Paulo. I got there by car, so don&amp;#x27;t know exactly how to do it by public transportation.

            <description>Pointless hitchhiking there, it&amp;#x27;s still not any close to getting out of the city. Got there following the advice of a man who told us there&amp;#x27;s a big rmarket from where trucks go to all directions after unloading. There are many truck drivers but the place is too big and would probably take a lot of time to find a ride. We were lucky because a guy we asked for directions offered to take us to a spot down the road. Otherwise, don&amp;#x27;t waste your time there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2014</description>

            <description>Os carros passam muito rpido, vrios caminhoneiros disseram que entrariam em Piracicaba. E faz sentido, olhando no mapa agora  evidente a razo: h vrias entradas para a cidade ainda depois desse ponto. Ainda assim consegui uma carona em 10 minutos, no foi exatamente para a cidade de destino, mas para a rodoviria de Piracicaba e de l peguei um buso para o destino. Se eu andasse 10 km, provavelmente, estaria em um ponto melhor para pegar caronas para o destino que eu queria: Capivari.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cars are very fast, several truckers said they would turn right and get in Piracicaba. And it makes sense, looking at the map now it is clear why: there are several entrances to the city after the point I was hikking. Still... I got a ride in 10 minutes, it was not exactly to my destination, but to Piracicaba&amp;#x27;s bus station and from there I caught a bus to my destination. If I walked 10 km, I probably would be in a better spot to catch rides to the destination I wanted: Capivari. But I was tired and the sun was hot...I just wanted to get out of the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2013</description>

            <description>My tip is to pay attention to the car plates, to see where are they going. I asked several times for a ride to cars with São Paulo - SP or cities around São Paulo plates, but I could only get a ride with someone from Londrina - PR. If the car is in Rio and it&amp;#x27;s going to Paraná, it is most likely that he will pass thorugh São Paulo to get there. It worked for me!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Diegocamposbraga (Hitchwiki), July 2016&lt;hr&gt;There&amp;#x27;s a service station and a Bob&amp;#x27;s in here. This is a good spot as it is already common among students from the Rural University of Rio de Janeiro to come and hitchhike in here towards Sao Paulo. You know, where people are used to see students hitchhiking is always a place with higher chances to get a ride.&lt;br&gt;To get here you can take the bus 193c from the central station in Rio de Janeiro and ask to get off at Bob&amp;#x27;s (if he/she doesn&amp;#x27;t know where it is, just say it&amp;#x27;s the next gas station after the toll booth in the exit of the city).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2016</description>

            <description>Take a bus 100 (dir. Terminal Bingen) from the rodoviaria in the city center and go until the end of the line (2,80 reais). The highway is just in front of the terminal. It&amp;#x27;s not a very safe place, the road has many turnings and there&amp;#x27;s no point walking up the road because there are no safer spots anywhere nearby. Our driver pulled over just because nobody would probably stop in such a dangerous place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2014</description>

            <description>There is not a lot of trees that provide shade here. But there is one that makes this a good spot when you want to go east to Alice. You are really out alone in the desert here so cars are very likely to pick you up. Provided there are some. Traffic east can get scarse after 5pm. So go early and take plenty of water- just in case.

I&amp;#x27;v tried several times, and I never stayed more than 15min.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2013&lt;hr&gt;I hitchhiked here with a friend... well, we just took a bus from the Juiz de Fora downtown to Salvaterra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OUR EXPERIENCE:&lt;br&gt;it was afternoon and we were two guys. maybe that were the problem. we spent something like 2hours hitching rides there, and we walked many meters ahead and had to keep distant one from the other to make it more easy to get a ride (coz they wouldn&amp;#x27;t think we were together).&lt;br&gt;so, two cars stoped and they were both going to Rio.. we gone with the second one with 2 places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so, i think it maybe get a little dificult (but not too much) but when someone stops to you, you have a big chance to get a ride directly to Rio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;VIDEO - hitchhiking from Juiz de Fora to Rio de Janeiro:&lt;br&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTlUTQBbr9k&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Peguei carona prximo  Churrascaria Potncia do Sul, logo aps o quebra mola, o que faz com que os carros estejam em menor velocidade e te vejam com mais facilidade. &lt;br&gt;Peguei no sentido para Alm Paraba mas muitos passam ali indo para o Rio de Janeiro.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Para chegar:&lt;br&gt;Basta pegar um dos nibus (Salvaterra, Monte Verde, Torreoes) na cidade e descer no pronto em frente a Churrascaria. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tempo:&lt;br&gt;1h30 - 2h30&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2014</description>

You can take the bus SANTO ANTONIO, or just walk, it&amp;#x27;s not that far from the center.

No point going any further, there&amp;#x27;s no lane for the cars to stop and it&amp;#x27;s full of curves.

There&amp;#x27;s a small gas station on the left side of the road (facing south) which didn&amp;#x27;t seem very helpful.

            <description>Didn&amp;#x27;t really like this spot.. cars can only stop in the emergency lane of the bridge, and 3 lanes with a lot of traffic to different directions going quite fast. After more than one hour didn&amp;#x27;t get a ride, but luckily I saw someone who stopped the car in the emergency lane of other bridge, and managed to get a ride out of the town...
&lt;br&gt;Next time will probably try the truckstop in the entrance of the town&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5, wait: 70 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―miguel_nsilva, October 2023&lt;hr&gt;A pretty good spot by the traffic lights, maybe too much cars, but I got a ride after 30mins..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2012</description>

            <description>this is one very good spot to hitchhike. there&amp;#x27;s a speed bump where cars slow down. it&amp;#x27;s very common to get rides here to, LEOPOLDINA and JUIZ DE FORA. If you want to go to Rio, here&amp;#x27;s the place to be too. Th get there&amp;#x27;s another place that is better, but you&amp;#x27;ll need a ride to reach there. Here, you can come walking, or take a bus, ask for a bus that pass in front of MITSUBISH VEMASA, and than walk till here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

The bus from Airlie beach stops a couple minutes walk away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tres facile soi nord ou sud. Beaucoup d&amp;#x27;espace pour les voitures. Il y a un arret de l&amp;#x27;autobus de Airlie Beach a 2 minutes a pied. Moi j&amp;#x27;ai attendu moins que 5 minutes ici. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2014</description>

            <description>Neste local, o posto Flesha é bom para caronas sentido Rio de Janeiro, porém no fim de semana há muitos caminhões parados. E ultimamente eles têm mais dificuldade em conseguir carga para sair, o que pode fazer sua carona demorar mais que o esperado. Durante a semana é tranquilo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Lpalmesi (Hitchwiki), January 2016&lt;hr&gt;Para chegar aqui pegue o onibus 901 - Viana l do Terminal Campo Grande e pea para descer no ultimo ponto da BR-101.

            <description>Not much shade, but there&amp;#x27;s place for cars to stop before railway. You get whole traffic from Port Hedland leaving the town. Got lucky with couple from NZ all the way to Broome. Took me almost 2 days to get lift (before I stood close to airport).
&lt;br&gt;Start early.
&lt;br&gt;You can probably find a spot to camp around, or walk 1 hour to touristic shelter close to airport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 120 min 👍, ride: 577 km ↗&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Bursztyn, June 2024</description>

            <description>Transportadora Belmok (near transportadora Jolivan). Take the street by Jolivan and after 150 m you find Belmok. There you can find trucks to Bahia, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Brasilia.... everywhere. You can talk with watchman and he left you stay in the door of the company (more or less 30 trucks for day).  In Jolivan is the same. In front of Jolivan there is a gasoline station with too many trucks too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2013</description>

The good place is the output of the gas station and direct approach to drivers stopped at the station . The vehicles do not pass many slowly , so eye contact is impaired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To reach the site should take any bus in Carapina terminal passing through the CONTOURNO and jump in Serramar post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2016</description>

Se voc no tiver ningum que possa te trazer at aqui, a opo que te resta  ir caminhando pela cidade indo rumo ao Parque de Exposio, da voc vai pedindo carona por todo o caminho, talvez vc consiga antes de chegar l. Se voc chegar l e ainda assim estiver difcil, voc pode caminhas uns quilmetros mais at o Bar da Reta (l tambm tem um quebra-molas), mas  meio longe principalmente se sua mochila estiver pesada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eu sou de Raul Soares e confesso que at mesmo sendo bem conhecido na minha cidade (porque tenho famlia grande l), algumas vezes que tentei sair de l pedindo carona eu levei muito tempo. A cidade  muito quente basicamente o ano todo, ento  meio torturante. Saia pra pedir carona beeem cedinho, por volta das 6h ou 7h da manh. As pessoas aqui costumam comear o dia bem cedo, inclusive quem vai pra outras cidades a trabalho.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Se voc tiver naqueles dias apressados, que voc precisa chegar rapidamente ao seu destino, eu te aconcelho a pegar um nibus de Raul Soares at Rio Casca (hoje em dia - dezembro/2012 - o valor da passagem t por volta dos 8 reais). Rio Casca est na BR 262, que liga Vitria (ES)  Belo Horizonte (MG), ento o fluxo de carro a  bem maior. (vou marcar onde voc deve pedir carona na sada de Rio Casca tambm, pro caso de voc preferir ir por l).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2012</description>

            <description>There is a good gas station where truckers stop to sleep and you can find many of them early in the morning toward Rio de Janeiro. I got there at 9AM and there were just few of them. I recomend getting there at 6 AM. I got a ride in 1 hour. To get there you have to take a bus 3933 or 3910 in Belo Horizonte in front of the &amp;quot;Parque Municipal&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2014</description>

            <description>people heading to Belo Horizonte use to hitchhike here. there&amp;#x27;s a place to the cars to stop for you after a bump. i&amp;#x27;m seen in the map that there&amp;#x27;s another junction just some kilometers after this spot (Av. Alberto Lima) maybe that&amp;#x27;s a better place to hitchhike as a lot people not leaving the city must be filtered here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the spot i pointed, i guess i generally wait around 40minutes for someone to stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2012</description>

            <description>There is not an awfull lot of options if you want to catch a lift south on the highway. This place is good since there is lots of space for cars to stop and they come in not to fast and you&amp;#x27;ll be well visible. There is hardly any shade here but there is a tree about 150 m to the north that provides protection from the sun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2016</description>

            <description>BP service station. You might find it hard to get a lift here but in my eyes asking people here is your best bet to get a lift north or south - especially on a hot day when it is hard to stand next to the road. Because there is a lot of local traffic that goes nowhere, it might be worthwhile to sit in front of the station and look out for cars coming down the highway from the north. There is a good chance that they continue south.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2016</description>

It&amp;#x27;s a speed reducer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For getting here: Take a bus in a Rodoviaria of BH to Lagoa Santa. (Costs R$4,20 - Jan of 2014). In Lagoa Santa going out of Terminal and take a bus to Lapinha and going out in the last point of BR. Walk 50 m until the speed reducer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just waited 1 minute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2014</description>

            <description>Threeways roadhouse. This place gets traffic from Darwin, Alice and the Queensland coast. I found the staff friendly and it is a good place to ask stopping cars for a lift. In my eyes way better than trying to stop one down the road. But you still might need a bit of patience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2016</description>

Pedimos (1homem+1mulher) carona num domingo  tarde e a maioria das pessoas interagiam com a gente fazendo algum sinal de porque nao dariam carona (carro cheio, vao virar logo  frente, etc), o que geralmente torna tudo menos entediante.

            <description>Feb/2014: I tried to hitchhike from this spot to Hwange National Park. Not any cars drove by for over one hour, but then the first one picked us up and drove us to the entry of Hwange. I later found out that in this area lions and other animals are frequently seen, so perhaps it&amp;#x27;s not a good idea to stay there with nowhere to run. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2016</description>

Make sure to start early (like 5 or 6am!) if you want to get long distances!

            <description>Around 4-5pm, there are the trucks full of vegetables going straight to Cochabamba. I hitched one, it´s a 9 hours adventure on the top of the truck with Quechua farmer.

            <description>East To Okongo&lt;br&gt;From Eenhana you can pick up a ride at the hike point across from the open market, near the Regional Education. Office Eenhana to Okongo is N$50. Eenhana to Oshikunde N$25. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;South to Ondangwa: &lt;br&gt;This hike point is on the south end of town past the grocerery stores and the Shell station. There is a single tree in an open area. Many people will be standing around and there will be some vehicles parked on the side of the road. NOTE: This hike point travels the gravel road--though it is cheaper is is bumpier and more prone to stopping. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;West to Onuno (Transfer to Ondangwa, Oshikongo):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This route doesn&amp;#x27;t have a designated hike point. Rather, linger around the Shell station on the north side of town. Look for a sedan--they are much more likely to take the paved route. This is a longer and more expensive ride to Ondangwa and you will switch cars at Onuno but it can ultimately be faster than stopping along the gravel. Your driver will find you a car at Onuno. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2014</description>

Once you found the right bus to go to Uchumayo you have to hop off at the final stop. From the main square just go straight down to where the highway is, maybe not quite obvious from the first sight but you won&amp;#x27;t miss it. We put ourselves about a 100 metres after the toll collect, at the very end of all the little shops. It took as more than one hour until a veeeeery slow truck stopped for us. It works but you need patience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2013</description>

Like describle at the spot ahead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Pr.ricardoliveira (Hitchwiki), December 2014&lt;hr&gt;Direction Goiania - take a metro to Sambaia and get off at the last station. From there it&amp;#x27;s a 15-min walk to the spot. When you reach the metro station, exit on the left side after the turnstiles (http://tinyurl.com/m6pykog), walk in the same direction that the train you came with is going until you reach Avenida 1 Norte. Follow it all the way until BR060.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2014</description>

            <description>even though it looks like the middle of nowhere, this is actually a pretty good spot to get north, as trucks slow right down at the intersection and can stop easily. We got a ride offer to Darwin with a truckie from here at night with only a torch to shine on our thumbs to show we were hitching!! If you get a ride offer that takes you past Kununurra - TAKE IT!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>If you want to hitchhike to Cuzco, first you need to go to Juliaca. It&amp;#x27;s unlikely that you&amp;#x27;ll get a ride direct to Cusco in Puno. Good news is, is not dificult to get to Juliaca. I got in this place by foot, it was a long way, if you can catch a mini van, i recommend, they only cost about 60 centimos (cents in peruvian money).&lt;br&gt;I got a ride to Juliaca in about 30 minutes in this place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2016</description>

            <description>Took me almost two days. 
&lt;br&gt;Shade till ~ 2 pm. Cars have decent speed and place to stop. Not much traffic. Most people go to Lake Argyle. (After 20 km they turn to dust road to the right)
&lt;br&gt;Hawk was attacking me every 15 mins, though only when I turned back to him. (pointing finger at him made him go back to his nest)
&lt;br&gt;Slept a bit further from street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 600 min 👍, ride: 508 km →&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Bursztyn, June 2024</description>

            <description>If you want to potentially be stuck on the side of the road in 45 degree heat, try hitching from Kununurra. There are no truck stops here, so you can rule trucks out as an option. (and that&amp;#x27;s usually the best option) After two and a half days of nothing vaguely resembling a ride, we gave up and bought a flight to Darwin. (cheaper then the Greyhound by the way). If you get stuck here, good luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

You&amp;#x27;ll have the gas station on your right, but most of the traffic seems local, better to walk along the highway for a few hundred m and hitch there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2014</description>

He was desperated because i was hitchhiking, saying that it wasn&amp;#x27;t safe.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, trucker said that that it was common for him to take hitchhickers there.&lt;br&gt;Take your on conclusions.&lt;br&gt;Mine is, i would do that again&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get in this place i asked a man on the street where was the road to cuzco and he indicated me a mini van that would take me here. it costs 0,60 cents.&lt;br&gt;Transportantion in Peru is extremely cheap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2016</description>

            <description>If you&amp;#x27;re going South on the Stuart Highway from Darwin, you might find yourself here. There is a tree which will provide some shade. Prepare to laugh (or more likely cry) when you see the hitch hiking graffiti that awaits you at the telephone cable mast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2011</description>

            <description>Good luck if you are hitchhiking into Kakadu national Park from here! You will need it. And other then entering Kakdu via Arnhem highwayfrom the west this is probably your best bet. So be patient and wait. There is a traffic sign up the road that provides shade well into the late morning hours and some trees that provide shade in the late afternoon. During midday it can get very hot so take plenty of water (I ended up taking ten litres during my hitching trp in Kakadu). Traffic can be as scarse as one car per hour even during the daytime. It&amp;#x27;s mostly tourists passing buy and most cars are loaded to the rim. If you fail to get a lift it is a 10-15 minute walk to the shop in town or the pub for a drink and a talk to the locals. If you camp out bush get well away from the road otherwise drunk aboriginal people might wake you up at night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2016</description>

            <description>Cars are speeding along from both directions. But you should be well visible and chances are that cars would stop. On top of that there are cars pulling out of the road house. Had a great time watching a flock of cockatoos playing on the sprinklers here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2016</description>

            <description>Noonamah service station features mostly local traffic and few long distance travellers stop here. If you are going north that should not be a problem but if you are heading down the Stuart highway you might want to consider catchiing a lift north to Coololinga and look for a lift from there as it is more likely to get a long lift there if you ask in front of Woolworths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2016</description>

            <description>This is a good spot for going south if you are not shy to ask drivers for a lift. Many long distance travellers stop here before leaving Darwin and a lot of them are easily dinstinguishable from local traffic. Also check the service station nearby. Try to go for a long ride (Katherine or further) if you want to cover some distance. Try to not get stuck in Katherine though - it is hard to get out. Noonamah service station is 20 km down the road but a lot worse then this spot so refuse lifts to there and try to find someone going further south. There is bus service from Palmerston to Coololinga but check the timetable well in advance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2016</description>

            <description>A good spot but the worst place ever to hitchhicke on the 65 cultures I went, from asia to america. Only expats (whites, Pakistani, Indians). Most Malawite will try to take advantage of your situation to make you pay (even if they are richer than you), begging is the national sport. Be aware that they can agree to take you for free but will change their mind one you will have make a couple of km with them, and they sometime become quite violent (on guy threatened me with iron rod). It&amp;#x27;s sad, but you can&amp;#x27;t really trust people there, try you will see. It&amp;#x27;s still possible, I hitchhike several hundert km (from Mzuzu Malawi to Zambia Lundazi and back,  to solve a visa issue) that was the most horrible trip I ever did, a more than a 20 years of international hitchhicke. You need to Waite for at least few hours, people making fun at you, I even got stoned and insulted while crossing small villages on foot (to get a better spot). I have been helped by few malawite (2 on 24 people, the 22 where foreigner). several hundert Malawit stopped, but ask money. 6 of them promise me a free ride but change their mind after few minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just to say: Mozambic, some part of Tanzania, South Sudan where very easy compare to Malawi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2015</description>

            <description>Where the BR 101 connects to what becomes the BR 99. There is a 24 hour gas station with nice employees, not too much movement in the gas station but you can hold a sign right outside to go North to Aracaj, Maceio, and Recife or South to Salvador and Feira de Santana). The only thing I didn&amp;#x27;t like about this place is that its still in the middle of the city so at night it might not be so fun as a girl alone. But got rides within 30 minutes north and south&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2014</description>

            <description>Heading to Lima.&lt;br&gt;Under the pedestrian bridge, where old Panamericana connects with new one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a turn of the main road before, but traffic goes pretty fast. There is still enough place for even for trucks to stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After my conversation with policeman, he left me on the same spot without problems. It seems that he took care just about my security. There is a strange district of the town  In front of the place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2015</description>

            <description>Even though this spot is in the north of Paraiso, there is a good gas station  (I was told it is the best one) to get a ride to the south. There is also in front of the gas station a speed bump, ideal to hitchhike. I got a ride to Brasilia in around 1 hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2014</description>

            <description>Oh and the fine for my drivers was about 10.000 MWK. Which tripled my total price for going to Lilongwe. Agreed to pay 5.000 at first. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2013&lt;hr&gt;Very good spot for going south into Malawi. Alot of Malawians import their cars from Tanzania and will be happy to take you.&lt;br&gt;They will expect some kind of payment though, DO NOT tell this to the police/army checkpoints, it is not allowed to take someone and have them pay since it will be seen as a taxi service, and the car doesnt have a taxi permit.&lt;br&gt;Just wait outside on the left side of the immigration building, coming from Tanzania. All cars have to pass through there eventually. If you&amp;#x27;re getting bored go out where all the cars are parked and ask around for destinations. &lt;br&gt;That way when someone finally gets their temporary import permit, you already know where they are going and will take you more easily because you asked them when they were waiting, and not when they&amp;#x27;re anxious to finally get going.&lt;br&gt;They wait might be long, but it will be way faster and cheaper than public transport in the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2013</description>

            <description>thats a good spot to Hike to the North, or Dar Es Salaam, behind the Roundabout is normally a police controle, so the cars have to stop for Police Check and after this you can easy ask them if they give you a lift. Truck drivers normally want some Schillings but its more comfotable then the bus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2013</description>

After saying no to 10 taxis and talking with a street food seller i managed to hitch a motorcycle, who went off to get a second helmet before giving me a ride.

In this spot all the different directions are possible.&lt;br&gt;There is a lot of cargo ships in Semarang, so you also have a lot of trucks coming and going to Jakarta and Surabaya&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2015</description>

            <description>Heading to Chiclayo.&lt;br&gt;Trucks are going from East to the coast direction. During the afternoon there were not a lot of them. I suppose more trucks are passing during the evening and night time, because of the hot weather.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The road side is good enough for cars to stop. There is a shadow from the hill. Be ready that a ride to Chiclayo will be long. Despite less than 300km of distance, trucks need up to 10 hours to make it by the mountain road.

You can ask the driver to lift you to the road 3N where more trucks pass. &lt;br&gt;BE CAREFUL. The sun is pretty intensive here and there are almost no shadow next to the road.

No trucks. Locals wants money (transportation is a popular business here), but it&amp;#x27;s possible to negotiate and even ask for a free ride.&lt;br&gt;My best was to get a ride for 3 soles (less than $1) to Jaen at 9pm.

You can from Piura get a ride here (or to Suillana) and then continue from here - for instance to Mancora. The Panamericana does not have a lot of traffic from here to the north at the coast, because there&amp;#x27;s another Panamericana more in the east - which is shorter if you directly want to get to ecuador.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2016</description>

I walked there from the center of Mancora, but you can also take a taxi for few soles. The spot is in about 50 meters before the gas station and bridge.&lt;br&gt;There is a sleeping policeman before, so cars and trucks are passing by slowly.

            <description>We got a direct ride to Jakarta from here. To get to this spot from the city take a yellow minibus &amp;quot;ampera — karya jaya&amp;quot;, it&amp;#x27;s shown on the google maps as well, and it&amp;#x27;s correct. Say the driver you need simpang kramasan. The only thing that after 5 minutes of standing there, the annoying cop appeared and wanted us to leave from this turn to the main road. We didn&amp;#x27;t do it though and just walked down away from him a little, he only seemed confused. Gladly we got our ride after a few minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 10 min 👍, ride: 520 km ↘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―otv3n, April 2024</description>

            <description>Direction to Loja. The road side is comfortable to stop. Cars are passing by slowly after turn and drivers can see you since the turn, thanks to the straight road and plain part of landscape. The traffic is quite low, though. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2015</description>

            <description>It&amp;#x27;s a bypass way of Cuenca. You can get here easily from the city center (30 minutes walking). Despite most of the traffic is local, you can get a lift closer to the exit out of the city. Interregional trucks are passing by as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2015</description>

            <description>We were three persons (2 guys, 1 lady) going to the National Park &amp;quot;Cajas&amp;quot;. No prob to get a ride, 10 minutes waiting and we had a nice ride. And I am sure that you can catch rides from here going to Guayaquil. &lt;br&gt;To get to this spot: Take bus #7 from the centre and hop off at Parque de Dragon. The bus costs you $0,25. Have the right coins available for the machine in the bus. Thumbs up!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2013</description>

            <description>I got here from Cuenca and directly got a ride continuing to the north. I&amp;#x27;D NOT RECOMMEND waiting in the city! Because there is one road around the city and one through it - so here you&amp;#x27;ll catch all of the cars! It&amp;#x27;s uphill, so they drive slowly.

            <description>Towards Bangko, Jambi, and further. Pretty easy to hitch to this turn from the city. A few cars were passing by, but maybe the third one stopped for us and it was a family going all the way to Jambi. We dropped off at Sarolangun. Once again make sure you have no intention to pay beforehand. Although we spoke a lot with the driver about what we do and how we travel, In the end, the driver asked me to pay 400k for 2 people which seems a lot for such a ride, and I managed to bargain until 200k. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 15 min 👍, ride: 182 km →&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―otv3n, April 2024</description>

To get there from the center you can get a bus to Marituba that drop you off one block from the gas station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2014</description>

            <description>It was the first time when we waited more than 10 minutes in Sumatra. Probably the spot wasn&amp;#x27;t good enough, cars were passing by too fast to break, so we had to change a few spots until we finally made it. To get to this junction from Padang Pajang you can simply take the small local minibus for 5000 rupiah (the one with an open door). We got a direct ride to Alahan Panjang (Danau Diatas), and the driver invited us to stay at his place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 30 min, ride: 89 km ↘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―otv3n, March 2024</description>

            <description>In hitchwiki.org is said that you can start hitchhiking in the middle of the bridge after the little house... From my experience cars will not pick you up because they still have to pass by the immigration check point in the Malaysian side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best thing to do is to continue walking after the bridge in the cars path (there is different paths for different types of vehicle). It&amp;#x27;s a kind of speedway, so be careful and stay close to the tab. You may see some locals doing the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Malaysian side you just have to ask where is the immigration for people that walking (is the same for people that come in tour buses).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After stamping your passport you just have to get out of the border basement and start hitchhiking near the cars exit&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Joaoguilhermeln (Hitchwiki), October 2015&lt;hr&gt;Very good spot, from Singapore to Malaysia. Go walking through the check point, pass the various border guards telling them you will be picked up a little bit further by a friend (they would not let you pass if you say you&amp;#x27;re hitchhiking), walk till the middle of the bridge after a little house, here it is!

            <description>From here 3 of us got a direct ride to Pekanbaru. It was a 15-hour ride because the car broke at some point, and the road conditions were very poor.

            <description>Few cars on this road. However, probably the first one will give you a ride. It took us 2 rides to get to Blangkejeren. The landscapes around are wonderful, looks like Siberia or something.

Traffic comes from Bogot, but there is also a lot of local traffic. Maybe I was just really lucky that day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detrs del crucero. Traffico desde Bogot.

            <description>It is an industrial area near the airport so, this bridge is mainly used by trucks and cars that come from the airport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The road is relatively new so the traffic flow is not that much. But you can easily stop a car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you come from the airport it is about 15 to 20 min walking.

            <description> Better to be there at 7h30, for the drivers check-in. I also tried to go talking with the drivers in the huge parking but it pretty difficult to find drivers who was going to leave soon (most of them didn&amp;#x27;t know when they would get their custom permission). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 120 min, ride: 451 km ↑&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2023</description>

            <description>Setting: We were two guys going to Cartagena. One guy looked Latin like, another one obvious foreigner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now: This is the place where the 2nd peaje (toll collect station) is where all the cars and trucks are passing. Don&amp;#x27;t try to walk there as it is mentioned in the description of Medellin, it would take you hours! Take a bus from the final metro stop Niquia to there and tell them to drop you off at this place. There is also a Esso gas station just after that. We found it general pretty hard to get a ride and we only found someone by talking to him while filling up. Hitchhiking in Colombia is not really fun I think. We didn&amp;#x27;t make very far and had to take a bus later. This is always a good option when you get stuck somewhere as they stop wherever you stand. So you need definitely time and patience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2014</description>

            <description>This is actually the same as the spot a few kilometres down west at the toll collect station. Someone brought us here in order to only have the vehicles passing by which are definitely going north at the Panamericana Road. It took us (two guys) almost two hours until we almost gave up before someone took us for a two hour ride. Hitchhiking here is feasable but it takes its time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2014</description>

            <description>Under a tree with shade. Picked up by a very friendly couple. We offered to pay for the ferry, but they didn&amp;#x27;t want and it seems like they didn&amp;#x27;t pay for the us in their ticket price. They also bought a watermelon for us!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 10 min, ride: 35 km ↙&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2024</description>

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;There is a lot traffic passing through here, as well as some songthaewa to Ao Luek and some other longer distance buses you can stop. There were a few other people waiting here, so I think it may be a bus stop and that makes it confusing to hitchhike from here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 120 min, ride: 63 km ↖&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2024</description>

            <description>If you can get there, it is a truck-drivers resting area, ideal spot for hitchhiking. They all go to Medellin or to Cartagena in the other way, they drive super slow, you have a lot of space and you can go ask directly to drivers having a break.The exact point is behind &amp;quot;Restaurant La Patrona, Planeta Rica, cordoba&amp;quot; on maps.

            <description>Setting: two guys, one Latin looking, the other one obvious foreigner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On our way to Cartagena we had a really lucky shot here. After standing here for about an hour, seeing ourselves already stepping back to the centre of the village where buses are leaving towards north there was suddenly one of this big container trucks stopping for us. The driver assinged us to sit behind the container in the very back. One of the most amazing rides I ever had! The driver told us that in case that the police would stop us he had claimed that we would have jumped illegally on the back and he wouldn&amp;#x27;t know about us. So we feared every time when the police was standing at the verge of the road but seriously, they&amp;#x27;ve seen us more than three times, a police car overtook us, military motorbikes passed by and no one was interesed in the fact that we sat there enjoying the panorama and the feeling of freedom. Thanks to the unknown driver for this great adventure!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2014</description>

            <description>Not a great spot, but still useful if you do not want to go inside Monteria. Try waiting just after the roundabout, you have a road that skips the city and bring you on the road 23 to Medellin.
&lt;br&gt;Remember you can also stop motos, you have higher chances to have short moto rides until Planeta Rica !

            <description>heard from locals you could hitch boats from this island. stayed for a week, swimming out to boats (cargo, yachts, launches, fish, etc) and didn&amp;#x27;t get any rides. had to hitch a small launch back to the coast to get to turbo. also sketchy island - before us last 2 people there had been journalists who were murdered (i was told). creepy place, there was a lady locked in her house, and we were told not to walk around too much. stayed with one very nice family in a little hut though. but still creepy good experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2015</description>

            <description>I asked drivers if they could take me with them. But most of them didn&amp;#x27;t know when they leave because they was waiting for their papers. They go either to Cotonou or Niger. 
&lt;br&gt;Finally I got one making a sign to a truck driver who was leaving and shouting &amp;quot;Djougou&amp;quot; (the ne of the next city) and he stoped. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 30 min, ride: 190 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2023</description>

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Perfect spot to hitchhike, south or north : large road, military control just above so people are driving slow, and you can wait under tree&amp;#x27;s shadows which is a huge plus on the coast.

            <description>Probably just stay here. The spot is good, there&amp;#x27;s a bus stop and a gas station. We made a mistake and walked further up, but couldn&amp;#x27;t find a good position and stuck for a while. Also, there&amp;#x27;re local city vans that are cheap and go quite far from the city, so you can go out for a better position.

I did it and told him that I didn&amp;#x27;t have money and inmediatly he asked to a van that was passing by. He said yes ans that&amp;#x27;s it. Local poeple do that. I wasn&amp;#x27;t asked for money at all.&lt;br&gt;Another way is to take a moto-taxi to the regional bus station and from there take a bus to Maracaibo.

            <description>There are huge trees at the roadside that provide shade. You will see one but you might have to walk there for 100 meters because apparently they are removed sometimes. A sign for Bavet helps if you want to get to the vietnamese border. A lot of trucks come by here, they are your best chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 20 min 🪧, ride: 172 km →&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2024</description>

            <description>There is a little shop. The lady in the shop seemed to have met hitchhikers here before, as she approached us with chairs, question in google translate &amp;quot;do you want to travel with no payment?&amp;quot;, and also offered us a cardboard to make a sign. Just because it&amp;#x27;s right after the turn from Skun it makes it more difficult for cars that are going from Phnom Penh direction to stop. Anyway, you can chill there, get some cold drink, and wait for your ride to Siem Reap. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 40 min, ride: 17 km ↗&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―otv3n, January 2024</description>

            <description>It&amp;#x27;s a bit behind the bus station. Take a mototaxi for $1 out of Siem Reap and hitch. Many cars, many westerners going on this road. You can find a shade below the big road sign, on the turn to &amp;quot;Sky Venture&amp;quot;. Good luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

No longer than 10min. waiting maximum, no matter if alone or with someone else. Never had any problems with the driver yet an open eye should always be kept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cuando vivia en 2006 en este pueblo siempre me fui en autostop a Tegucigalpa que esta una hora para ir.

            <description>From Balintawak Station go down the clover intersection and walk pass the first road going right. Be careful as the traffic is dense and fast, also there are sometimes police under the bridge. Once you are there, people will stop for the crazy foreigner. Maybe you might have to wait long if the traffic is extra fast. In any case, be very very careful as the safety lane is narrow and there is a wall on the side of the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2014</description>

On the Senegal side, I walked in the direction of Saint Louis until the last petrol station, where all the small bus starts their way for Saint Louis. I hitchhiked on the road until the first small bus stops, asked him if I could go for free because I´m only doing hitch hiking, he invited me with lots of laughs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Garept (Hitchwiki), June 2015&lt;hr&gt;There are cars who go all the way until Morocco, but at the time i was there everyone were asking for money... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Juaum (Hitchwiki), April 2015&lt;hr&gt;Border with Mauritania.

            <description>I wanted to hitchhike towards Diama border crossing but then i saw that bus with people sitting on a roof and i didnt want to miss my chance for this experience especially when the guy said it costs 2000 senegalese francs, which is like 3 euros. At the end of the ride i realised he ment 10000 (fuck french, srsly), but he got 7500 (guess i still overpaid). Well it was a nice safari, i saw acrocodille, monkeys, wild pigs. But also had to pay 200 MRU for the national park as a white skin tax. If you have a chance just hide yourself at the checkpoint. The road was in a good shape and with some trafgic till Keur Macene, then it was an unpaved road with traffic tgat seems mostly consisting of buses and taxis. But you might be lucky.  I&amp;#x27;d just be nervous about getting stuck in this area over night cause of the crocodilles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 0 min, ride: 86 km ↙&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Alpazel, April 2024</description>

            <description>Hitchhiking is Dominicana&amp;#x27;s capital Santo Domingo is possible, but makes little sense, since the public transportation is so cheap. It is definitelly the hardest place in DR to hitchhike. If you want to get out of the city, i&amp;#x27;d reccomend you going to the last metro station Maria Sanchez and than walk a bit to the gas station on a highway. The vast majority of cars stopping there will go to Piedra Blanca, Santiago de Los Caballeros, Puerto Plata and so. The other directions heading to the east are a bit harder. I reccomend you going on the edge of the city with some minibus and than just standing on the side of the highway. Dominicans are very welcoming to stop you and take you with them, usually without asking for any money (in 95% cases)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 30 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―honzatravels, August 2023</description>

            <description>A police checkpoint, again the police does the job for you. The police in Tidjikja is friendly and had no problem with me camping wild and hitchhiking. Sadly i had some brain failure when the policemen stopped a minubus and said this one goes to Nouakchott for 800, i just took it. I consider it as a mistake, but the fact is that up until Sangrave the road was deserted. If you are in a hurry you can take a bus to there and then continue hitchhiking.

            <description>Perfect spot. You will find a huge mostly empty gas station with a lot of space for cars to stop and you will be visible to drivers. In the morning hours the traffic was low, almost no motorbikes at all, so it&amp;#x27;s easier for cars to stop here. As most cars pass slowly here, you can even hitch a truck. We got a direct truck ride to Huế in about 5 minutes.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;To get to this spot from the city, you must get bus number 06 (Vinh – Hà Tĩnh). It starts from Chợ ga Vinh (near the train station, google it), and passes through the city so that you might catch it in a different place, we got it around the Bến Thuỷ area. It goes all the way to Hà Tĩnh, but I suggest you get off at this intersection or directly at the gas station, otherwise, that would be difficult to get away from Hà Tĩnh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 5 min, ride: 387 km ↘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―otv3n, November 2023</description>

            <description>Freight train towards Orizaba / Vera Cruz. If you have the time it&amp;#x27;s definitely worth the wait! Stand just to the east of this point next to the tracks and look for the &amp;quot;Ferrosur&amp;quot; locomotive heading away (east) from the yard - there are normally 2 a day, early and late. Chances are there will be other people there waiting for the train, feel free to talk to them. The ride takes about 8 hours and get&amp;#x27;s a bit cold at night (December).. no problems with police or rail employees - quite the opposite! Also, if you have to wait over night you can camp right next to the tracks and not have to worry about banditos or policia!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2012</description>

            <description>You will possibly wait a bit cause the cars arw going too fast there and there is nothing to slow them down, so they cant even notice you very well. Try to show up as much as possible to them.

            <description>Thats a good spot if you want to hitch from Mexico to the south of the republic (directions: Cuernavaca, Tepoztlan, Oaxtepec, Chilpancingo, Acapulco). Theres a toll where you can ask for a raid but if its not possible, you go walking 200 meters from the toll to a bar next to the road, in your right hand. In that place youre going to find a  painted white shadow (my own shadow with the thumb up) on the asphalt, this is an art project Ive been working in Mexico City, painting different  shadows in all the right places to get out from the city. If you want to know more info about this, you can contact with me: aniol.macau@gmail.com THANKS! and good trip!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2011</description>

            <description>Here is the place where I started a nomadic art project related with hitchhiking in Mexico. I painted in white on the asphalt my own shadow projected on the road with my thumb up.  I did this action in all the right places in Mexico City to get out from the city.&lt;br&gt;I painted the first shadow in that place, near the art college of Mexico City, ENAP. It&amp;#x27;s an abandoned petrol station. I think it&amp;#x27;s not a really good spot for hitchhiking, but I just wanted to explain the project here.&lt;br&gt;If you want to know more info about this, you can contact with me: aniol.macau@gmail.com THANKS! and good trip!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2011</description>

            <description>this rating is for the Central de Abastos near Iztapalapa, SE of downtown.  It can be a good place to catch long rides with truckers if you speak good Spanish or maybe are a good looking gringa!  Check out the Pension (tractor trailer parking lot) to chat up drivers.  However, many of them stay here for days or weeks at a time.  So, while you might get lucky, it is much easier to catch rides out on the freeway.  take a bus to the Cuota if you&amp;#x27;re headed on 57 towards Queretaro.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2013</description>

            <description>Buses from Xalapa center to Banderilla can let you off right here. It&amp;#x27;s the road to Puebla and Mexico City, but the free one, so you&amp;#x27;re not likely to get a long distance ride. The spot is a good one, cars have tons of room to stop and can see you long before they get to you. Try to get one at least to Las Vigas, where you can easily get on the paid (cuota) road and hitch from a tollbooth (caseta). &lt;br&gt;If you get stuck, an intercity bus from TRV company going further towards Las Vigas, Perote, and Teziutlan stops here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2015</description>

            <description>Buses from Xalapa center to Banderilla stop about a 5-minute walk away. There&amp;#x27;s a traffic light right before the division between the free (libre) and paid (cuota) highways towards Puebla and Mexico City. If you&amp;#x27;re going long distance, the paid one would be better, but those going there would be in the inner, further lanes, so it can be hard to get a ride from here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2015</description>

            <description>Going from Terjit to Tidjikja during ramadan I came to the police checkpoint. After a short dispute with the policemen he understood i wanna hitchhike but didnt let me, instead of it he hitchhiked for me. He got me a free ride in a truck. Was a nice ride, just had to keep watching the driver who was falling asleep cause of fasting in 40 degrees. The fact i got in with a help of police made passing further checkpoints easier (they called the terjit checkpoint to verify). The road to Tidjikja is paved and mostly in a good condition, but it was nearly empty (maybe also due to ramadan and off main turistic season time). With the truck it took like 8 hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 60 min, ride: 324 km ↘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Alpazel, April 2024</description>

On normal school days you can find students from the nearby University (FIMEE) that go everyday to Irapuato.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2012</description>

Google Translate works pretty well now compared to 8 years ago. I found that showing a digital map to drivers is always confusing for them, so I prepared a simple hand-drawn map with a few nearest towns on the way. Showing this map to the driver works perfectly in combination with the phrase &amp;quot;Bạn đi đâu (Where are you going)?&amp;quot;. Also &amp;quot;miễn phí (free)&amp;quot; is pretty helpful to let drivers know you are willing to get a free ride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 2 min, ride: 34 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―otv3n, November 2023</description>

            <description>Very few cars leave oudane, most in the morning so get up super early. I missed most of the cars, two stopped but demanded payment (quite rudely). The a couple where full, but for hours on end there was nothing. I hiked out further and got a lift with some tourists in late afternoon. Be willing to pay or wait, and get up early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5, wait: 400 min, ride: 166 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Treetree, January 2024</description>

            <description>When going from Len south, there is not much option, but under the &amp;quot;Milenium&amp;quot; Bridge, a tall metal structure made for pedestrians to cross the highway. Here, many buslines going to Guanajuato and Silao stop, and you might get a ride even though the trafic is so fast. There is also a place where small trucks stop to eat, so you can also ask for a ride in person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2012</description>

            <description>This is the place where they form the train towards to Nouadhibou. We came here around 12pm. Some people are gathering around passenger wagon. If you want to ride on the top of iron ore watching all the desert landscapes just move further and find a car that suits you. Train moved to Fedrick in 1,5h or so and also stopped there for around 30min, so we could change the car closer to the train head. The time might be different, so it&amp;#x27;s better to get here earlier. Make sure you bring warm clothes and something to cover yourself during the night since it might be cold, also take something to protect your eyes (we had a goggles), enough water and some snacks. The whole ride takes around 20h.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, ride: 634 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―otv3n, August 2023</description>

            <description>Quite hard to find a ride since most of the drivers are heading North or South after some time, almost none of them heading West out of the maze, but we found a lucky ride. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To access, bus number 3 leaves you quite close to the access, and if you follow people walking you will end up at the service station. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2016</description>

            <description>This is the official punto amarillo on the autopista nacional heading east, which means that you will find yourself in competition with lots of other (Cuban) hitchhikers. Cars are legally expected to stop, and you can raise your chances by waiving with 20 pesos bills (like most Cubans do). waiting time can vary between minutes and hours. to get to the punto amarillo, take the p7 from parque central, get out in san francisco de paula and either walk or take a ride along the primer anillo to the punto amarillo. when lost, ask cubans, everyone knows where the punto amarillo is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2016</description>

Muscat is full of Taxis, so one or two of them might approach you before you will get your free lift. I waited once 10 minutes and the second time around 15 minutes for a ride to Al Amirat.

            <description>What goes up must come down. There are many cars always heading down the mountain so it&amp;#x27;s relatively easy to hitchhike into town or farther.

            <description>Toll Gate - excellent spot for rides north towards Quanzhou. From train station (Take RTB 1 from city center) it&amp;#x27;s a 25 minute walk along Xueyuan Rd and Haixiang Ave to get here. Toll gate and highway is fenced off, but there&amp;#x27;s a hole in the fence under the bridge Haixiang Ave / toll gate road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2014</description>

            <description>Toll gate - staff was a bit nervous of having a foreigner around, but overall ok spot to get a ride north towards Fuzhou (waiting time 1 hour). Bus 13 goes along Chenghua Rd and bypasses the toll gate. Catch the bus from the city center (old tow) on West Street close to the clock tower (bus 13 goes along part of West St., then along East St. and Donghu St. and on to Chenghua Rd - get off when you see the highway and the toll gate - easy!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2014</description>

There is plenty of space for cars to stop and it doesn&amp;#x27;t seem like there were any cops or patrol cars passing by.

            <description>There usually are a couple of hitchhikers at the wall next to the city, but I tried there for several hours without much success. There is not much traffic going south and most drivers don&amp;#x27;t take you if you are not willing to pay. So walking out further helped me as the driver couldn&amp;#x27;t hope for paying hitchhikers after me anymore. There is a roundabout with space to stop for cars afterwards here (but you can try hitchhiking all the way here). Be careful of a guy living in an improvised hut directly at the road who started touching me sexually but was harmless after I told him that I am not interested and walked away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2015</description>

            <description>There are two police checkpoints next to each other here in direction north. They are quite far to walk from the center of Laayoune but it is possibile and I saw a bus running there as well (I think it was number 3 and should cost around 2 Dirham, but better ask). The police didn&amp;#x27;t let me hitchhike because they thought it isn&amp;#x27;t save, but they quickly found a truck for me that was going all the way to Guelmim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2015</description>

            <description>I stayed here two hours. By my opinion very comfortable place, a lot of trucks going to main road from here to the way San Antonio. But because American don&amp;#x27;t like hitchhikers, probably it will takes some time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2016</description>

            <description>To hitchhike towards west, that&amp;#x27;s problably the only possible place, although not the best one. After the shopping center, continue walking some 15-20 min until the mirador. There&amp;#x27;s plenty of room for the cars to stop, although they are speeding at about 80km/h.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I used this place three times (waiting time from 20min to 1h)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2016</description>

            <description>Hitchhiked with a local man heading north to Taba on his pick up truck with his two sons in the back. We couldn&amp;#x27;t communicate in language and the two boys wanted to give me all sorts of possessions of theirs for me to take. I gave them little funky wire men in return. I wanted to give their father some spare cash in return when he fuelled the car and he graciously refused over and over. Extremely kind and generous people. Simple human to human connection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

            <description>Hitchhiking in Jordan is in general super easy if you are a European tourist, everybody wants to help you and you never wait more than 10 minutes no matter where you are, carefull though because many times people expect you to give them money for the ride, so you have to make clear from the beginning that you are hitchhiking, we went directly from Aqaba to Wadi Rum which is a very popular destination &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 2 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2023</description>

            <description>Direction: Emeishan. Might also work for the direct lifts to Chengdu. However, it will be way easier to catch a ride taking you to the express way junction where you can hitch on the toll gates (or the ramp).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stand just after the big road crossing. There is a large bit of wide roadside, as well as the bus stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s very easy to get there by simply walking from the main bus station. (where the buses from Emei and Chengdu stop)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Used this spot once, after missing by last bus back to Emei. Took me less than an hour (well after the dusk, take this factor into account) to catch a ride to Emei.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2012</description>

            <description>To get here, take the metro to Helwan (1 EGP) and walk South for 15 minutes on Mansour until the traffic thins out. Then take any microbus (1 EGP) going further South until you reach the highway. There will probably be other people waiting for a bus or shared transport. Just walk a bit further and try to wave down cars. Best to take the highway El-Karimat El-Zafrana. This road is in  a very good condition and is being extended further and further towards Luxor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2014</description>

They all thought it was illegal, but there is a loophole in their law which allows standing on the shoulder for solicitation, just not in the actual roadway.

            <description>If you find yourself stranded in the hell of Agadir, do one thing and only one, take bus 12 to Ait Melloul (4dh), ask to be dropped at this roundabout, perfect spot to go east, lot of traffic, and plenty of space to pull off for the cars, we (3px) got a ride after 15 minutes to Oulad Teima (from there you can eventually catch a red bus to Taroudant, which costs just 8 dh). If you don&amp;#x27;t make it out of the city, there is this bus 361 going to Oulad Dahou, out of town, stopping at this roundabout.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2015</description>

            <description>Destination: Chuzhou, Nanjing, Beijing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toll gates. Loads of cars going towards the north. Staff doesn&amp;#x27;t mind hitchers at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to get here from the lakeside (Eastern bank):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Take the bus no 12 going towards .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. After around 30-40 minutes ride get off at . (bus stops are quite well signposted)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a while you will be going along the huge elevated road. Your bus stop is the first one after the bus turns right, leaving the elevated road behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Go back to the street running along the elevated road. Turn right. After a very short walk you&amp;#x27;ll arrive at the stop . Take the bus no K191. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bus stop is located in front of the quite big shopping centre, tons of people around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. The bus will follow the elevated road for a longer time before taking the turn left. After a while it will rejoin the express way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After around 40-50 minutes ride (depending on the traffic conditions) the bus will take turn the right, leaving the small highway junction. You should be able to see the toll gates already from here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get off at the first stop after the junction - .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go back to the junction. Turn right, walking along the highway (it&amp;#x27;s perfectly fine for the pedestrians to stroll around, just exercise enough caution for the speeding cars)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After around 15 minutes walk you should arrive at the toll gates. Stand just in front of one the booths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It took me less than an hour to get a long-distance ride which took me far beyond Nanjing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2012</description>

            <description>Toll Gate - good spot for rides towards Shanghai (waiting time 15 minutes, staff didn&amp;#x27;t let me stand on the highway side of the gates though). To get here take the metro (Linping line) to Nanyuan station. Walk five minutes South along Yingbin Rd to the toll gates.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2014</description>

Just after the big express way junction. Direction: Dujiangyuan, Wenchuan, Songpan, Jiuzhaigou National Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Chengdu North Railway Station:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Take the D-type train to Xipu. In November 2012 the cost of the single journey ticket was 5RMB. The ride takes approx. 15 mins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Leaving the Xipu train station behind, follow the street (full of yummy street food!) to the first crossing. Turn right onto  street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Turn left on the first crossing. &lt;br&gt;You should be on Puxing street now. Follow that street for around 15-20mins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. You will eventually arrive at the crossing with Xixing avenue. Turn right.&lt;br&gt;Walk all the way till the express way junction. Go past it. Just beware of the speeding cars! The cops shouldn&amp;#x27;t bother you at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Finally you will arrive at the toll gates which catch the traffic coming from the Northern stretches of G4201 express way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are literally loads of cars stopping here. A lot of friendly and smiling drivers!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extremely easy to hitch a ride to Dujiangyuan, should take no more than 5-10 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bit harder for further destinations, yet still it took me only around 20 mins to catch a ride to Maoxian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, hitching here, you miss a lot of traffic coming from the inner areas of Chengdu. That&amp;#x27;s why you might consider another toll gate, located a bit further to the North-West. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(see the white spot I added.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2012</description>

            <description>A good spot to pull over. We hitchhiked here twice (in March 2024 and February 2023), and in both instances, we waited for about 45 minutes. The waiting time heavily depends on the time of day. It&amp;#x27;s one of the places in the desert region of Morocco where we waited the longest for a ride. Nevertheless, we had some of the most memorable hitchhiking experiences here in Morocco (with a film producer heading to a Netflix film set in the middle of nowhere and with a super lovely Moroccan couple heading towards Zagora very late in the evening).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 45 min 👍, ride: 60 km ↘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2024&lt;hr&gt;Many competitors and I&amp;#x27;ve waited here the longest in my entire trip. Trucks usually go to the mine and wouldn&amp;#x27;t pick you up. Eventually a really nice guy picked me up and the ride to Zagora is very scenic where we stopped to enjoy the view and he invited me to his home twice to eat together!

            <description>Direction Béchar and anywhere north. All people in Taghit (very touristic city) know about this gas station as a place where many cars stop before leaving. So you can walk here and wait from the gas station side under trees shadow. If it doesn&amp;#x27;t work, take a minibus back to the city and move into a departing one. Cost 150da (60cent).

            <description>I got a lift here to Asni after walking out of the old town and hitchhiking on the way at diffferent places for over 3 hours. From the old town you will pass about two roundabouts, after that there are not many more side streets, so you might as well stop there and hitchhike. There is some traffic light on the way as well after which is a better spot, as cars are not fast there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2015</description>

It&amp;#x27;s a good place for hitchhiking to several places. You can hitch from here to the Dead Sea, towards route 90 and then south towards Eilat or north towards Tiberias, Sea of Galilee and the Golan Heights, to Palestinian cities that are north of Jerusalem, to West Bank/Samaria settlements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2012</description>

            <description>Going from north direction Tinghit. Up until this point it the road was very empty but still hitchhikable, taking small distances and a lot of time. From here it seemed like basically no cars going that way. But you can sit in local cafe, talk to locals (this village is not touristy, has very authentic vibes) and try to hitchhike from your chair, maybe you&amp;#x27;ll be lucky. If not, there is a minibus to Tinghir for 50 DH stopping right on the spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Alpazel, February 2024</description>

            <description>HaShalom junction (next to the haShalom rail station) is a good place to hitch hike if you&amp;#x27;re north-bound. At the rail station, walk east until you arrive to the Ayalon highway northbound traffic lights. The road is accessible and very wide - Favorable spots are a factory front with a lot of parking space, and a small hitch hiking station further down the lane, even though you are more likely to be seen next to the factory. Most cars either travel to the Kfar Saba-Raanana area via hwy #4, or all the way to Haifa via hwy #2. Remember that in Israel, the sign is extending the index finger and pointing towards the road (sideways, basically) instead of the traditional thumb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>I hitched from here to Leh (and back) just after the road was opened, it was fantastic. I thought I must start early to make it to Leh in one day, but that&amp;#x27;s wrong, u better take your time for that trip, there are so many camps in stunning locations where you can sleep, eat and continue the next day. With private cars (many indian tourists) or a truck. Best road I ever hitched &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2015</description>

It was late in the afternoon, heavy fogging, very minimal traffic, maybe 40-50 cars in 15 minutes. The spot itself is in the corner next to the STOP sign so can hitchhike both roads and people have to slow down anyways (one road for STOP sign, the other for hairpin corner). I rate it 3 stars as the spot for cars to stop isn&amp;#x27;t the best. Thankfully traffic is very minimal so that&amp;#x27;s not really a danger. First couple who stopped also went to Pico do Arieiro so it was an easy hitchhike to the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 20 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2023</description>

            <description>Forget about it, people.  In my opinion, the access roads present a major problem for the viability of hitching.  People are already driving too fast, and there are no good shoulders.

            <description>San Diego is a good city to find hitchers at. Very friendly people. Getting picked up is just a luck of the draw for newbies, but if you know what you are doing, you can get one withint like 160 minutes or less&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2014</description>

            <description>the junction has been changed a bit much since march 2013, the bus stop to the west is not at all placed well for hitch hiking but in all other directions they are well put- behind traffic lights. הצומת השתנתה מאז מרץ 2013 והתחנה לכיוון מערב ממוקמת בצורה ממש לא מותאמת לטרמפים,אבל בכל שאר הכיוונים התחנות ממוקמות טוב, מאחורי רמזורים.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Waterpolo159 (Hitchwiki), May 2014&lt;hr&gt;Two backpackers took a ride from here to Haifa in no-wating time.

            <description>It&amp;#x27;s not a good spot. It&amp;#x27;s the beginning of the tunnel to the expressway and the cars going there drive on the right lane, making it almost impossible to stop for you or even see you. I waited 3 hours before an English speaking helpful guy drove back just to take me. I would try to find another spot that connects to the expressway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Canaydemir (Hitchwiki), June 2014&lt;hr&gt;I waited for 40min at 9h in the morning on a Sunday. Then got ride to Fukuoka (I was heading Osaka).&lt;br&gt;I asked the driver to stop in a car park on the highway. Although is prohibitted is the best place to get a ride. I rode to Osaka from Nagasaki with 4 different cars, wating an average of 20 min from car to car. Hitchhiking in Japan is great!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2013</description>

There is a stop light so cars have slowed down and have a place to pull into and you can also get traffic leaving the gas station.

            <description>Going towards Seixal. Really not ideal as cars don&amp;#x27;t have a spot to stop in. We got lucky and someone picked us up really quickly, just stopping on the side of the road, blocking the way of traffic. Try to hitchhike well before the solid line starts so you leave space for other cars to overtake the car stopped to pick you up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5, wait: 5 min, ride: 6 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2023</description>

            <description>There is a good number of people climbing the mountain (especially on weekends) and it&amp;#x27;s fairly easy to hitch back from the parking area near the temple back to Aso town. People will know you are a traveller without a car who just came here to climb the mountain, so they won&amp;#x27;t have any worries. A tip for climbing: follow the path going left and climb the rocky route to the top first (it is well marked with yellow arrows), make a circle clockwise and make your way down by following the paved route near the old cable car station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2014</description>

            <description>Hitching north out of DFW on US-75 is tough. This spot really isn&amp;#x27;t the greatest, but I got picked up surprisingly fast.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The issue is that there really isn&amp;#x27;t a good spot for vehicles to pull off. And well also, there is no transit in the area so it&amp;#x27;s a long walk to get to this spot.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The Costco near Parker rd. would probably be a better option. It&amp;#x27;s a substantialy shorter walk, and The truck entrance seems like it would offer a good place for vehicles to pull off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 40 min, ride: 75 km ↑&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―AngryOtter, June 2023</description>

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;That said, people that live in Melissa are even less likely to stop for you. I got picked up by a California transplant, that does a lot of backpacking. He was a really cool guy.

            <description>There&amp;#x27;s a police checkpoint here. I hung out with the police, drank tea with them and they practiced their English while I waited for a bus to Mashhad which they put me on for free, about 2 hours of waiting at night.

Another guy showed up at the same on-ramp, going off the same info from this site. We talked, he started walking, because it was MY on ramp, and instantly we both got a ride. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Fumbles (Hitchwiki), April 2016&lt;hr&gt;Love&amp;#x27;s truck stop near exit. Best place to hitchhike south from Phoenix area-- to Tucson or further on I-20 East. Large on-ramp. Hitchhiked here two times. I recommend to wait for a ride at least to I-8 junction (many truck stops) or Tucson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>There is a service area somewhere around here (I think it was called Ishiyama). It is a nice spot and even if you are travelling from Nagasaki to Kumamoto (or vice versa) it&amp;#x27;s better if you go here. There is also an underpass and you can cross to the other side of the highway (the other service area).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2014</description>

Got a lift around 10, but probably only spent about 20 minutes legitimately hitchhiking. Held a sign for I-75S, because the road splits. There&amp;#x27;s no good place to pull off, but there&amp;#x27;s a stop light, so it works out. Also noteworthy, I was passed by several cops who didn&amp;#x27;t bother me =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(female, 20s)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2016</description>

You may have to wait 1-2 hours for a ride, but it will be long. I have hitchhiked both east and west from here. Beware of gay drivers looking for favors.

            <description>Was dangerous to enter... there is no space for the cars stop. You must walk some hundred meters on a bridge without not space for walk. I found really dangerous, and iligeal as well, you are not allowed to enter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2018&lt;hr&gt;Roads to chengdu and sichuan. Great spot to hitchhike! Unfortunatly i don&amp;#x27;t remember the bus who go there. I think it&amp;#x27;s 315 but i&amp;#x27;m not sur, you can take from the west avenue. It&amp;#x27;s around 30mn to go there by bus. You have to exit 1 or 2 stop after the tv tower on your left. You can not miss it, so ifyou are not sur it&amp;#x27;s the tv tower you see,  It&amp;#x27;s not the tv tower. Then keep walking same direction as the bus (or go back on your feet if you past under the highway in the bus)Then you have to walk along the road who go to the toll gate. There is a sign &amp;quot;forbidden to pedestrian&amp;quot; but nobody care and chinese also walk along that road. It&amp;#x27;s not dangerous and only around 100m walking to the toll gate. I find a 300km drive in 10mn, a lot of place for car to stop, they drive slowly and can see you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2015</description>

            <description>I had the worst time trying to hitch from here. It was mostly local traffic and no one seemed at all interested in stopping. Waited over four hours before deciding to head back to Santa Barbara and try near the university.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Stephiewonder (Hitchwiki), November 2012&lt;hr&gt;Going north. A bit tricky to hitch as there isn&amp;#x27;t a sidewalk, making this spot illegal. Still, I&amp;#x27;ve seen, picked-up, and got a lift here in relatively good time. I have a feeling it&amp;#x27;s a dependable place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2012</description>

            <description>Good spot but only a few cars here. There are a cafe and a gas station. Drivers often only go to Taourirt (which is not far way) so you may have a hard time finding a car that goes to Fès for example. One of the employee of the gas station was also very rude to us. Otherwise, a good spot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 20 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Lolodugang, May 2023</description>

            <description>When going to Aleppo, I was stucked in a petrol station just before Homs. Someone dropped me and my sister who just arrived in syria here. I think some services did not want us to hitchhike this time. Anyway, after trying the two sides (hide officers were telling us cars to aleppo were on the other side, true story !!), we finally found a car to Hama. Don&amp;#x27;t care about it, I&amp;#x27;m pretty sure it was expectionnal. It never happened after. Plus, i&amp;#x27;m pretty sure this service station was sort of good option!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2012</description>

            <description>At first I was worried that the spot was gonna be bad because it really doesn&amp;#x27;t seem like cars could stop anywhere. BUT: after only 2 minutes I got a ride to himeji with a very kind family.
&lt;br&gt;They stopped their car in a road parallel to the onramp, so if you attract cars from the main road, they will have a chance to stop there and reenter onto the highway, so don&amp;#x27;t worry.
&lt;br&gt;I even got help from the local firefighters at their building just down the road, one of them walked me all the way to the point and explained me where to go and what to write on my sign.
&lt;br&gt;If you need the bathroom, further down the road there is a gas station with a clean bathroom, so your needs should be covered.
&lt;br&gt;I recommend this spot, even though it seemed sketchy at first.
&lt;br&gt;Edit: on my sign I wrote 姫路方面 which means &amp;quot;towards himeji&amp;quot;
&lt;br&gt;You can ask your ride to drop you of at the next SA, or service area (サービスエリア) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 2 min, ride: 62 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Hans, March 2024&lt;hr&gt;By first sight it really seems a bad spot, as it is described above. However, it worked out quiet well. I just had to wait for 20 mins. This spot works for both directions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2017&lt;hr&gt;Might seem like a poor spot because there is little place for cars to stop, but I did manage to find a ride here. Plus, it&amp;#x27;s very easy to access from central Kobe. This road leads right up to the Hanshin expressway, both directions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2014</description>

            <description>I went here again.

Alternatively, further down the other side there&amp;#x27;s some weird garden feature that connects directly to the parking area but is surrounded with lots of trees and bushes - presumably you could jump the fence there easier, though it&amp;#x27;s further to walk to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Aik (Hitchwiki), May 2015&lt;hr&gt;Service area close to Kishibe station on the Kyoto line.

            <description>We stood just before the highway, behind the guard rail. Big sign saying no stopping / hitching. But... A car stopped before police we saw any police.
&lt;br&gt;There are tunnels to get around the roundabout without playing Frogger in the road.
&lt;br&gt;Hitch towards limmasol / larnaca / lefkosia (Nicosia)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The roundabout is hard for someone to stop in. They could, maybe, but it&amp;#x27;d be dangerous and no one seemed to stop there. Also, not great luck at the gas station 6min walk from there.
&lt;br&gt;If all else fails, there is a bus stop about 5min walk from the gas station with intercity busses going every hour or so. Between 4-8 euro, depending on which city. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 25 min, ride: 116 km ↗&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2023&lt;hr&gt;After the roundabound, just when the highway starts, there is plenty of space for the cars to stop and they don&amp;#x27;t drive really fast.

            <description>Got dropped off here.  I wouldn&amp;#x27;t suggest staying at all.  There&amp;#x27;s a nearby McDonald&amp;#x27;s with free Wifi if need be.  Walk or hitch (the road south of McDo) to the next on ramp, 3,2 miles northish.  That other on ramp feeds the freeway with more traffic and there is more space on the on ramp for cars and trucks to stop&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2012</description>

            <description>Nice spot, lots of room and a lot of traffic heading north on I-5.  Most traffic is going to Bakersfield, though, so if you&amp;#x27;re going farther up the 5 freeway, you should make a &amp;quot;Sacramento&amp;quot; sign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2012</description>

            <description>seems like a bad spot, but I had finally just gotten off the spur interstate and said fuck it. Got picked up in 30 minutes.

            <description>This entire on/off ramp is great thanks to truck stops, gas stations and fast food.  You can either ask people as they pump gas or use the on ramps.  A sign helps, especially if you&amp;#x27;re headed north on interstate 15 or east on interstate 40.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2014</description>

Is the entrance of the highway so go careful when walking. On that side of the road, at left after some big plants which hide the cars view, there is some margin on the road enough for a car who wants to stop to do it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can wait there having some space of visibility, or stay in the intersection of the cats who came from the roundabout or directly from Nicosia road, the cars from round about they are really slow but they can&amp;#x27;t really stop.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get there you can hitchhike from the city asking to take you out, never tried in Larnaca but in Nicosia works well.

            <description>Service area from where you can hitch a ride to Tokyo quite easily. You can go in and out freely - if you walk down into the valley, there is a bus terminal right underneath the highway. From here busses run to Shizuoka station. If you want to get here from Shizuoka station, then take bus #1391 to Yatsu terminal ().&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2014</description>

            <description>At the entrance of the highway direction to Larnaca in that case (cross the bridge for another direction). Just before the entrance there is a oil station but facing agia napa, and a bus stop and a lot of space to stop, but my experience is better when I hit my feet into the exit road. Cars from highway they are too fast but there is small chance to them to stop.   If you are in Agia Napa you can walk here, but Iit will take some time, you can hitchike around the road in any bus stop, it work fine for me. Bus stop closer is from Nissi avenue, 101 or 102 is and example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2015</description>

There&amp;#x27;s decent traffic, so it&amp;#x27;s doable, but I wouldn&amp;#x27;t recommend it if you can help it. Make sure you have a map with the next SA you want to get to with you that you can just point at, because the expressway branches crazily soon after this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Aik (Hitchwiki), May 2013&lt;hr&gt;Big service area with access from Otsu station and thus Kyoto.

            <description>As usual: walk to the edge of town and start hitching from there. There&amp;#x27;s not much, but enough traffic to make it easily in smaller hops along the paved road to Nowdeshah (or alternatively to Nowsud) and all the way to Howraman At Takht. Fantastic people, awesome scenery, short waiting times - hitchhiking at it&amp;#x27;s best!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

I was here asking for rides for over five hours with no luck. It didn&amp;#x27;t help that there were half a dozen tweekers bumming around who scared the drivers and tried to make off with my backpack.

            <description>Actually a horrible spot, but the stoplight gives you enough time to let a decent length of cars see and consider stipping on the very short stretch of shoulder that&amp;#x27;s wide enough to stop. Got picked up by an ex grower who brought me back to his house and smoked me the fuck out with his family, of all things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2016</description>

The 2nd vehicle picked me up, couple of Germans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could probably hitch much earlier before this spot :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2014</description>

            <description>Not much space to stop, but still managed to get a direct ride to Daegu within 5minutes. If you&amp;#x27;re luck you will get a ride fast. If you&amp;#x27;re not you will have to wait a little longer but someone will take you sonner or later.

            <description>Big service area with good infrastructure. I used it to get to Nagoya. Quite a big distance on foot from the nearest station but once you are there it&amp;#x27;s easily accessible from the north side, where you find stairs that lead to the small park of the service area. Traffic wasn&amp;#x27;t that much but decent enough to get picked up quite fast.

            <description>Spot at the roadside shortly after the bus terminal (for direction North towards Saqqez and Bijar). To get here take a savari (700 Toman in October 2014) from Enqelab Square to the &amp;quot;Terminal&amp;quot; and walk for 100 meters or so. There&amp;#x27;s not that much space for cars to pull over, but as there&amp;#x27;s not too much traffic this is not an issue. Make sure the ride is for free, as taxi drivers from the nearby terminal might also stop for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

            <description>The employees seem to be hitchhiking friendly, and had no problem with me asking people around the gas station. I got a ride to California after 2 hours and a half. Not very busy though&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Emanuele19956 (Hitchwiki), March 2016&lt;hr&gt;There is a truck stop with cafe (employees allowed me to sleep at table while raining) and also a rest area. Long highway on-ramps east and west directions, easy for truckers to pull over. Medium amount of vehicle traffic at ramps, can also approach cars at gas station/ truck stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

Awesomely, I got picked up by a truck headed to Reno, NV, that took me straight to Albuquerque, NM. &lt;br&gt;Besides, the truck stop is surrounded by nice woods to camp in. The truck stop staff is actually pretty helpful.

            <description>Going north. People get the drift that you&amp;#x27;re just traveling up the coast. All the same, there are some older people in this area who aren&amp;#x27;t super keen on picking you up. However, there are also the baby-boomer locals who used to hitch back in their day. I might try Cayucos drive before this spot, but it was decent all the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2012</description>

            <description>Four massive truck stops at the four corners of this entrance and plenty of cars flowing, and yet no one stops. I got stuck here for a day and a half, until someone finally stopped and took me miles east of the city. &lt;br&gt;Besides, my tent got blown away by a thunderstorm during the night. If the weather doesn&amp;#x27;t look good, just spend the night inside the Pilot truck stop, as the employees are friendly there. Just chill in the TV room.

            <description>The spot was very good. It can be accessed very easily through a passage behind the convenience store and you won&amp;#x27;t be walking where cars drive.
&lt;br&gt;The station has everything, toilets, wifi, electrical plugs for charging your devices, Food etc.
&lt;br&gt;I got picked up after one hour waiting time on a Monday. I started at 10am and got a lift at 11am.
&lt;br&gt;It took me a total of 4 rides to get to Nagoya station and the drivers were always very respectful and curious why I&amp;#x27;m hitchhiking in japan.
&lt;br&gt;Tomorrow I&amp;#x27;ll continue hitchhiking to Osaka and after that to kumamoto, just to see how far I can go.
&lt;br&gt;On this trip I never had any worries about unsafe road conditions, people being rude, not having food or a toilet. Everything was available all the time and it was a very good experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 60 min, ride: 303 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Hans, March 2024&lt;hr&gt;The spot is really good. Lot&amp;#x27;s of cars, many people go to toilet or getting a snack. I got a ride after 45 mins. However, I was waiting in front of the exit. I experience it works out better waiting in front of the entrance of the convenient stores / food hall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2017&lt;hr&gt;I got a ride in about 20 minutes to Shizuoka. Great spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2017&lt;hr&gt;Within 10 minutes, someone walked up to us and offered to take us all the way to Kyoto. It&amp;#x27;s a big place - don&amp;#x27;t go there too late though, or you&amp;#x27;ll mostly find cars with sarary men taking a nap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Matsumoto Joe (Hitchwiki), November 2014&lt;hr&gt;Most drivers wouldn&amp;#x27;t look at me, or would just smile and go, the truck driver that gave me a ride told me that hitchhiking is not that common - he only took me because he was used to hitchhiking from Australia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Pax (Hitchwiki), July 2012&lt;hr&gt;Khoku PA () on Tmei Expressway (), otw to Fuji/Gotemba, Hakone, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, western Japan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reachable from Tkaichiba () station on the JR Yokohama line. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;full description: http://hitchwiki.org/en/Tokyo#T.C5.8Dmei_Expressway_.28.E6.9D.B1.E5.90.8D.29&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2012</description>

            <description>I&amp;#x27;ve hitched out of here many times going west and its my fav spot for westbound. My wait has been 3 minutes to 1.5 hours. Its high visibility and has a place for folks to pull over.

            <description>I waited 5 hours here, but there were some external circumstances. About half the time there was another hitchhiker there with two dogs, so it&amp;#x27;s possible somebody would&amp;#x27;ve stopped earlier otherwise. And early on I declined a ride because the place seemed good and he was going too short a distance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ofercarmon (Hitchwiki), November 2014&lt;hr&gt;Seemed like a good spot to get on the I-40W. There&amp;#x27;s a big truck stop, plenty of cars, a not-too-bad on-ramp right after a traffic light, so cars are not going by too fast. But I got stuck here for a long time. Now I checked and I see there&amp;#x27;s a prison in Marion. Maybe that&amp;#x27;s why nobody stopped...&lt;br&gt;Standing in the on-ramp didn&amp;#x27;t work for me, as it&amp;#x27;s a bit hard for trucks to stop over there.

            <description>FERRY LIFT: alright, this is the place where you wanna go if you&amp;#x27;re looking for a free lift on the ferry. Coming from Tangier, if you get dropped at the passenger terminal roundabout, don&amp;#x27;t go left, cause that&amp;#x27;s the passenger terminal and you don&amp;#x27;t need to do anything there, don&amp;#x27;t go right where you see the truck sign cause that&amp;#x27;s just a parking lot I guess, GO STRAIGHT, where it seems like you shouldn&amp;#x27;t go, but that&amp;#x27;s where you want to go, walk a couple of kms, you&amp;#x27;ll get to the place where trucks are scanned before boarding (on the right hand side). There you&amp;#x27;ll find all the trucks waiting, start asking all the drivers for a lift to Algeciras, remind them they are allowed to take one more passenger on the truck for free, the port staff is friendly, won&amp;#x27;t give you any trouble.&lt;br&gt;It took us just 15 minutes to find a ride for me and my girlfriend, it was a three drivers turkish company, they were happy to take us with them. &lt;br&gt;Alright, second step, getting your passport stamped, that&amp;#x27;s the hard part, before entering the scanning area, you need to pass through this toil boot-looking gates, where you&amp;#x27;ll need to go to the customs office on the left and get your passport stamped. there may be different officers, the one that was on shift got us into tight jams, he didn&amp;#x27;t want to stamp our passports, we told him we were trying to hitch hike a ride because we didn&amp;#x27;t have any money, and that what we were doing was totally legal, he said he didn&amp;#x27;t have the permission to do it, and told us to go to the main police office at the passenger terminal (that&amp;#x27;s a long walk), if it happened to you, DEMAND him to call his chief and INSIST ON IT, otherwise you&amp;#x27;ll have to go all the way back to the terminal. After half an hour we finally got our passports stamped and green light to go.&lt;br&gt;Third step, long wait for the truck to be scanned, and for the drivers to get all their papers, took us HOURS. Finally we could leave and go to the embarkation place, but be aware that tourists cars have the priority on boarding, so trucks will have to wait till there&amp;#x27;s room left on one of the ferries.&lt;br&gt;At the end of the day, it took us just 15 minutes to find a ride but 7 hours before  touching spanish land (the ferry is just one hour). &lt;br&gt;NB: trucks pay several hundreds of euros for the ferry (12 hundred my truck), so hitchhikers being passengers usually get one free meal on board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2015</description>

When I was there, the side of the road was littered with signs of people who had hitched there before, and it&amp;#x27;s right next to a large truck stop. It&amp;#x27;s very useful to have a sign that indicates whether you are going to be taking I-40 or I-75. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2012</description>

            <description>Port Tanger Med&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ferries to Spain (Algeciras) several times a day. When you get to the terminal, ask for a boarding card from one of the booths and fill it. Then waltz to the X-ray and someone probably asks for your ticket. Explain that you are a hitchhiker and that the trucks are allowed to have one passenger apart from the driver. Be prepared for lengthy conversation though. Smile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you are done with the formalities a minibus will take you to down to the port. Moroccan drivers are your best choice. Just convince them that you don\\&amp;#x27;t have drugs with you (Arabic sign \\&amp;quot;I have no drugs\\&amp;quot; makes them smile). Explain that all they have to do is to take you into the ferry and in Spain you will walk out of the ferry by yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It might take a while but eventually you will get a ride to the ferry. Then you just go and have a nice meal with the driver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just before reaching Algeciras you should try to hitch a ride out of the port (otherwise be prepared for a long walk).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2011</description>

            <description>I had to pay for the ferry after hitchhiking from Paris to Tarifa. It costs 37 euros or 39, did not try in algeciras. I confirm, you can sleep on the beach, it&amp;#x27;s a wonderful place and a quiet rest for a night or two !&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewan gweznou (Hitchwiki), April 2012&lt;hr&gt;16 hours and we left..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―CZV (Hitchwiki), June 2011&lt;hr&gt;The wiki will tell you to hitchhike the ferry to Tanger from here, by asking the truck drivers - only problem - there are almost none. Better go to Algeciras directly there are hundreds of them.

            <description>Very busy ramp, gas stations and restaurants all around. Apparently this ramp has been used by a lot of hitchhikers and tramps, as the guardrail is covered in signatures and hitchhiking tips by people who have tried there before. One even says that if you&amp;#x27;re hungry, you can walk to Waffle House and get a whole menu for free. &lt;br&gt;I got a ride after 1 hour, and the driver even took me out for lunch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re hitching out west out of Nashville, consider investing your time walking to this spot rather than thumbing on entries closer to the city center. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2016</description>

            <description>04/2013 We stood there for about an hour before getting a lift to the outskirts of LA. Wouldn&amp;#x27;t go there during summer (hot hot hot).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Maltoe (Hitchwiki), July 2013&lt;hr&gt;05/23/2013&lt;br&gt;Had a hell of a time getting a lift -- 6 hours to go just a few miles south.  Seems that people aren&amp;#x27;t very receptive to hitchhikers here.  Lately there have been an outpouring of highway patrol (probably because of Memorial Day).  I&amp;#x27;d just avoid the Vegas area at all costs; it really sucks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Incogitatus (Hitchwiki), May 2013&lt;hr&gt;Decent spot for hitchhiking south on interestate - 15.  I didn&amp;#x27;t use a sign because it&amp;#x27;s fairly obvious I&amp;#x27;d like to go somewhere south, and it seems that most people are either going to Stateline or California.  I did wait about an hour or two because there was heavy traffic which makes for grumpy drivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2011</description>

            <description>This is where many truck drivers pass by, between town and the parking lot. Just hanging around here for a while, talking to the drivers (especially those who are alone) in some basic French should secure you a ride. However, many people only leave the following day or hours later, so this is the option for laid-back hitchhikers. If you are more in a hurry, follow the instructions for asking drivers in the terminal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2014</description>

            <description>I tried getting a lift to france here and at other spots around the harbour for two days without success, giving up and taking a bus to Barcelona in the end (If you go with Alsa and have a used ticket of the ferry, which you can get by asking people at the exit of the main building, you get a 20% discount). There are some cars going to France and further but they are mostly full or where not willing to take me. There are some trucks exiting here as well. This seems like the best spot, it is well lit so you can try your luck here at night as well. Traffic comes in waves with the ferries, so you have periods without traffic which gives you time to rest. I tried along the road towards the bridge as well and behind the bridge, but this was the most comfortable spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―LukasR (Hitchwiki), June 2015&lt;hr&gt;The place to stop when you come back from Morocco. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Me and a friend waited for a car going to France from here at the end of the summer.

We waited here for an hour to go north to Seville, but fortunately a guy stopped and suggested another spot.

            <description>The first really viable hitchhiking spot along this road going towards Takayama. There&amp;#x27;s a small parking area in between two sets of traffic lights with just enough room at the end of the parking lot for someone from the road to pull over.

            <description>Good spot on the road side. Easy to find a ride in all directions (east towards Kas or west towards Fethiye). It&amp;#x27;s walkable from Patara beach, but a passing car will probably give you a lift when they see you walking...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

There are no real alternatives though, if you&amp;#x27;re heading for Tokyo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Matsumoto Joe (Hitchwiki), November 2014&lt;hr&gt;So admittedly, someone picked me up after about 20 minutes. It wasn&amp;#x27;t going where I wanted, but as I was giving up anyway I accepted. It&amp;#x27;s one of those depressingly tiny parking areas that have no traffic. It might look like a tempting way out of Nagano, but I really wouldn&amp;#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Aik (Hitchwiki), May 2013&lt;hr&gt;A tiny service area in walking distance from Sakai station up a fairly steep hill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2013</description>

            <description>The gas station is not very busy (or so it seemed to me). However, if you walk another 500 meter or so along the highway you come to a toll gate, which makes a perfect hitching spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tomtom (Hitchwiki), October 2014&lt;hr&gt;Gas station/resting area on the Tehran-Tabriz highway.

            <description>I went to the 7eleven bought a pen to write my sign and then got picked up by a nice guy after nearly 10 min. He took me to Takasaki city and dropped me off at a supermarket where I could walk up easily to a road headed towards the highway. The 7eleven was on road 291 and the speed limit was around 50km/hour or 70km/hour but people drove slow enough to read and react to the sign. It was on a Sunday maybe it won&amp;#x27;t matter to you but I have a better track of getting rides on a Sunday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 10 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2023</description>

            <description>Milos is great for hitchhiking like the rest of the islands. I wanted to hike up to the highest point. Caught several rides from the edge of Adamas up until the roads become an adventurers paradise. Luckily found a dutch couple touring the island by car and dropped me off at the bottom of the mountain. After finishing my hike, caught a ride from that end of the island straight back to Adamas town. Incredible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2016</description>

Good place, drivers can see you from distance,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Marcelklimes (Hitchwiki), February 2015&lt;hr&gt;We were two at 11am. There was a fluent traffic, a lot of car traying to take A7 to leave Mlaga. We just was waiting 10 minutes or less. Its a pretty cool place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2014</description>

            <description>Really not the best spot as it is an on-ramp...but cars will have time to see you and pull over...which for us around sunset was the miracle we needed to make it to Granada! Could be better, but could also be a lot worse/ Just don&amp;#x27;t stand too far up the ramp because the cars will be going to fast by that point! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 30 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―RB, March 2023</description>

            <description>This place seems to be a good spot, because there is a place to stop, so I stood here with a cardboard &amp;quot;DIRECCIÓN GRANADA.&amp;quot; Although the distance was short, unfortunately it was not my lucky day. I waited a total of 4 hours (four times an hour each) and was unable to find a ride to my destination. If you hitchhike here, arm yourself with a lot of patience. I also recommend catching a hitchhike a little lower down, where cars are not going so fast yet. One driver stopped there before, but he only drove 17 km. In addition, a family stopped and wanted to take me for money. Maybe you guys will have more luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5, wait: 240 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―NotLuckyHitchhiker, March 2024&lt;hr&gt;The best place to go towards Sevilla, Granada and Cordoba.one hour walking from city center or take the bus 2 (1.30 €).

If you&amp;#x27;re going to Algeciras, it&amp;#x27;s recommended to find a direct ride here rather than taking a shorter ride along the highway towards Algeciras.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), April 2015&lt;hr&gt;Great spot!

On the upside there is an obscure Ancient Greek tower 5 minutes from this spot so +1 for that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 25 min, ride: 6 km ↖&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―csillagkohó, June 2023</description>

            <description>Really excellent spot, but it takes a little walk. I took the 71 bus from downtown Santa Cruz to Watsonville transit center, where I walked to Salinas Rd. Along Salinas, I passed by some strawberry farms with no fence and had a nice strawberry breakfast and walked about 4 miles until I got to HWY 1, which is legal to walk on right after it meets up with Salinas Rd. Here I got a bottleneck of all the traffic leaving SC south and got a ride 5 hrs away to Ventura in about 15 minutes. I think it&amp;#x27;s a great way to leave SC going south. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2012</description>

            <description>This island is really small making it perfect to walk. Traffic is very minimal which is cool. But if the one car I tried to catch a ride with didn&amp;#x27;t have a bunch of stuff in the back seat, I would have gotten a ride. I still will give a good rep for hitching here. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2016</description>

            <description>We got taken relatively fast to the area we wanted to go (the surroundings of Lido de Noto) and there&amp;#x27;s space to pull over. However, the road is a bit dangerous to cross/reach by foot. The location is also quite sketchy with a lot of garbage and stray dogs. I suppose there are better spots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 20 min, ride: 6 km ↘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―csillagkohó, June 2023</description>

But If it wasn&amp;#x27;t for a lucky ride I might&amp;#x27;ve been stuck there a a lot longer. There&amp;#x27;s a car maybe every 10 minutes.

            <description>Easy to start here, but you should find a direct ride to your destination, especially to Bizerte. Locals recommended to start n the morning. 2 guys took me to Ras Rajel where i waited and gave up till a minibus took me to Nefza. There i waited 1.5 hour, gave up and took another minibus to Bizerte.
&lt;br&gt;Besides, this spot is just at the city&amp;#x27;s hostel gate &amp;quot;Maison de Jeunes Tabarka&amp;quot;. 10 tnd for locals, 12 for algerians, 18 for other souls.

            <description>Hitchhiked here on January and almost no cars getting into the motorway to the North. There is 2 big gas stations on both side but if you are going to North I would suggest you to hitchhike where car from Almeria get into the motorway with a cartoon &amp;quot;Murcia&amp;quot;. Waited 3 hours to get a lift for 40km, and 6hours to get Murcia. After Murcia it is much easier so one possibility would be to take a bus to Murcia from Almeria.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2015</description>

            <description>Ended up waiting for 40minutes, but it’s an amazing spot. Basically all the traffic from Adana and southeastern Türkiye headed towards Istanbul takes this road to avoid Antalya. Tons of diverse traffic and great pull off area. Right after a traffic light (even though it’s a highway) so there’s tonsss of time for cars to see you.

At present, they are doing some works on the road just past the roundabout, so there is plenty of room for someone to stop.

            <description>If you&amp;#x27;re planning to go westside, Mersin or even further, you can hitchhike from this point. This is the entrance of the highway near from the first class apartments. So it is safe to make hitchhike because they will try to understand you. But on other points they may not trust to you. So here is good!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>Hitchhikers hell. After several hours got a 5 min ride up to the next roundabout. You can walk 3,5 km to the next gas station. It&amp;#x27;s quiet nice and big. It&amp;#x27;s a bit complicated to get there, but it&amp;#x27;s possible. We started to walk on motorway (but remember - it&amp;#x27;s not legal). After some 500m you will see a little trail going parallel the motorway. Climb over the fence and better use that one, it&amp;#x27;s way more safer. And it leads directly to the petrol station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2016</description>

            <description>This place is infamous for getting stranded as there are no villages beyond here, just alpine desert. Que: no trucks or local cars except short distance farmers. There are tourist cars, but they&amp;#x27;re often full or not too Hitchhiker friendly, and there arn&amp;#x27;t loads of them. it&amp;#x27;s not impossible, but don&amp;#x27;t expect it to be easy, be prepared to wait a couple of days, don&amp;#x27;t miss opportunities to hitch, and be open to hitching back to khorog or willing to pay someone with a car at the hostel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5, wait: 2000 min, ride: 211 km ↗&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―flomp, November 2023&lt;hr&gt;Start your way early. There might be no cars at all afternoon, that was our case and we had to spent a night in Langar. 6-7am is a good time to start. Locals usually don&amp;#x27;t go to Murgab (super rare), but some of them go on 10-30-50km for a pasture. Most of the cars going to Murgab are tourists (probably a few per days). It&amp;#x27;s better to wait for a ride at least to Khargush, there is a military base and checkpoint. There is almost nothing else between and high opportunity to stuck in a middle of nowhere with no cars at all. However we relied on our luck, took a 10km ride out of Langar, walked a while and got a ride with a tourist directly to Murghab. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 1000 min, ride: 210 km ↗&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―otv3n, September 2023</description>

            <description>It is not any perfect place but it is possible to hitchhike. Be careful, the drivers go very fast so it it is harder to get a ride. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2018&lt;hr&gt;Very good place if you want to get to Lagos or Sagres.

            <description>If you&amp;#x27;re going direction Lagos, then it&amp;#x27;s here or in the junction around 300m down the road in the direction to Sagres where you can hitch. By the junction the cars pass quite fast, so I decided to check this spot; it&amp;#x27;s still not perfect, but at least they have more space to pull over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2016</description>

            <description>Used it two times with success, not a lot of space, but people often go to the border of Spain. My recommendation is to ask to drop you to the next highway rest area (Posto de Abastecimiento Cepsa A22 OLHÃO) if they just go to the border or not to your destination. People often rest here before going further into Spain &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 20 min, ride: 9 km →&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Emric, October 2023</description>

            <description>Most viable spot to hitchhike from Burgau, as traffic can be very little from the village itself. Enough space in both directions to stop cars and it also has a bus in case nobody stops for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 15 min, ride: 10 km →&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―ORMO, August 2023</description>

            <description>I was dropped of at the entrance of this village (the last one before the road crosses the mountains to Kalamata) on the 15.02.2013 (friday) around 16:00 and after walking towards the end of the village with a sign (in greek) in my hands someone picked me up ...a dentist from Sparti going once a week to Kalamata. I don&amp;#x27;t recommend to enter the mountain area as a hitch-hiker as people might not take you being afraid of having no phone connection in emergency case. But I definately recommend you this trip on that road as it is the most beautiful mountain crossing on Peloponnese :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2013</description>

            <description> waited maybe 25 there, and  spent 10 minutes eating melon with a young melon-selling lad who offered me some. Anywhere along this broad highway will do. There is place for cars to stop without worry (for them and you).&lt;br&gt;There is one problem; make sure to ask the driver if he goes to the EXACT place you are saying, and ask him if he is taking you FOR FREE.&lt;br&gt;My story goes like this: a guy stopped, picked me up and stopped at Viranehir. He asked me for 10 lira.  nearly fought with him to make him take his greasy dirty hands off my bag.

            <description>If you&amp;#x27;re hitching East towards Guejar Sierra or the trailhead of Vereda de la Estrella, perhaps the most hiked trail in southern Spain, there are pullouts all alongside this road in that direction. I walked from where the road forks towards Pinos Genil while thumbing and got picked up from this spot in less than 20min. This area is small villages so the traffic is commuting villagers and vacationers to the Sierra Nevada mountains/nearby lake. Long rides probably aren&amp;#x27;t possible but rides east to the trailhead or west to Granada are likely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also an air conditioned bus that goes to Granada from this village (and also Guejar Sierra) approximately once an hour on non-weekends and holidays for no more than 1.7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2014</description>

            <description>I agree, easy to walk there from the old town. Pingyao is a small town, so not much traffic, but this is China and hitchhiking is easy even with little traffic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tomtom (Hitchwiki), July 2014&lt;hr&gt;Toll gate. Destination: Xi&amp;#x27;an, Taiyuan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No advice for the buses here. From the walled old town it&amp;#x27;s around an hour walk. You might also want to take a cab to get here if you are short of time (and have someone to share the costs with).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tell the driver to take you to .  (Gos gngl. Shufi zhn) - &amp;#x27;express way, toll gates&amp;#x27;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I personally preferred to get there by foot, quite interesting walk through some modern developments in Pingyao, so radically different from the postcard look alike old town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One member of the staff was not particularly happy to see me standing directly in front of the booths. However it did not matter, as I got my lift within a few minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2012</description>

            <description>I was a little worried about this spot. It&amp;#x27;s such a small town. However I was only there for 30 minutes before someone picked me up. It seems there&amp;#x27;s a lot of people going this way to go to the Grand Canyon and other outdoorsy things in southern Utah and northern Arizona. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2014</description>

            <description>Entrance to the highway - mainly used by cars going to Spain, so it´s not a good spot to hitch direction Faro and further west. If you´re coming from Vila Real de São Antonio, try reaching this place to hitch, because before there´s too much local traffic. Our experience (April 2015) - we were trying to get on the highway and after around 45 minutes a Ukrainian driver picked us up and changed the direction to the national road going to Tavira.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), April 2015&lt;hr&gt;Waiting on the side of the road is a very good spot to get on the highway,much better the the one close to Tavira because it&amp;#x27;s after all tolls and all locals use it. We go to the spanish border in 5 minutes. When we were walking there, the police stayed close the roundabout and even they suggested us this spot. ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2014</description>

It is a petrol station. From here they mostly take the Highway to Madrid, even for sort distances. If you go east (Murcia, Valencia, Barcelona)or west you can get a ride here to any of the other three fuel stations that are located before the cross with the A-92 (which is the highway going to Murcia). In my opinion the bigest is the second one (GALP). However if you want to reach Crdoba, I encourage you to wait until somebody brings you directly there, otherwise the most probable is that you get stack in any village in between (it already hapened 2/3 to me). Be patient, you are in Spain. Good luck. November 2007&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2007</description>

            <description>There are good pullouts on either side of the road, but it is a slight bend so visibility is not the best. It might be the best way out of Quentar (why you are in Quentar in the first place is a mystery). Cars are speeding down the mountain, but I stood on the wrong side of the road so southbound traffic going around the bend had time to react to me. It&amp;#x27;s likely that most traffic south is going to Granada, so it&amp;#x27;s just a matter of willingness to pick up a hitch hiker. I wouldn&amp;#x27;t count on getting a long distance lift though. Got picked up by a cyclist going to Granada in 20 min.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2014</description>

            <description>This spot is nice to reach Cordoba. Remember anyway that you are in Spain and it may take long.

            <description>Doesn&amp;#x27;t seem to be a good spot, because cars drive fast with no reason to slow down, but there&amp;#x27;s no much traffic so they can see you from far away, we got picked up after 20 minutes.

            <description>Just put out your thumb or  sign saying bodrum - waited for no more than 15min. Good spot to get an the peinsula / going west. easy to reach afoot from the citycenter. Literally you can just stand anywhere beside the road and put your thumb out - somebody will pick you up. Keep the small metrobusses in mind, they do stop frequently right in front of you - just deny getting on to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2014</description>

            <description>In my opinion, is not a good place but is the only place close to the Seville for go to Huelva/Portugal.

            <description>With a sign to Huelva, took me a bit more than an hour. Not the best spot but to get out of Sevilla without taking public transport it&amp;#x27;s good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 75 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Menno, May 2023&lt;hr&gt;We (2 peepz) tried hitchhiking on the split of the road directly after the bridge, there is a traffic light, but we didn&amp;#x27;t manage to get a ride for two hours. Thought about people could stop on the bus line, not sure if that was obvious for them. Also because of the traffic light buses stopped in front of us and you don&amp;#x27;t really get seen. Local pep recommended the spot (while waiting more outside Sevilla), guess you need more luck. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2022&lt;hr&gt;still no vendors?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Sitko (Hitchwiki), January 2017&lt;hr&gt;2016.10  There is no vendors anymore. You must have sign here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Dzeikobas (Hitchwiki), November 2016&lt;hr&gt;Still people selling stuff there, we had similar feelings about their influence on our hitchhiking. Not a lot of space for the cars to stop. After ~1 we blindly decided to reach by bus from nearby Plaza de Armas a seemingly good spot where wr had more luck. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), April 2015&lt;hr&gt;With a sign HUELVA, with my girlfrienf, we ait here only 5 minutes. But the guy who pick-up us wanted to drive us until Caceres... :) :) :) Very funy ! We leave him when he put gas-oil in a gas station near the split between te autovi to Badajoz and the national road to Portugal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Railway (Hitchwiki), March 2015&lt;hr&gt;This spot could be good but hitching as two here turned out difficult, we had some people selling stuff next to us and they scared people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Kapten kastrull (Hitchwiki), November 2014&lt;hr&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not a bad location but not good respond for hitchhiker.&lt;br&gt;During Holy Week holiday, I try to hitchhike to Faro,Portugal with sign.&lt;br&gt;But no car stop in 2 hours although a lot of car and busy. I gave up and took bus finally.&lt;br&gt;I think it&amp;#x27;s not good idea to hitchhike in Spain. I never try again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2014&lt;hr&gt;This is my favourite spot in Sevilla to hh back to Huelva/Portugal. Me and my friends never took more than 20 min there waiting for a ride. The cars can stop on the zebra and the spot is really close to the city center.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2012</description>

            <description>Got a direct ride to Daegu after around 30minutes of waiting. It was already dark but still managed to get the ride. Cars would stop and tell us, that it&amp;#x27;s dangerous, that there is no way we can get a ride to Daegu (too far), but you should not be discouraged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Pawel (Hitchwiki), April 2015&lt;hr&gt;Get off at Yangjae Ciziten&amp;#x27;s Forest Station and walk to the intersection. You can actually get on the highway (be careful) and if you walk for about 200 meters, there is a service station. Wait at the end of the service station where cars slowly drive to the highway. I don&amp;#x27;t think you will wait more than 10 minutes. It&amp;#x27;s a good spot for heading south to Daejeon, Daegu or Busan.

Although there is a hard shoulder, traffic is going way too fast for the drivers to see you AND stop safely on the hard shoulder before taking the bend. Also, it is totally illegal to hitch here, so try not to get dropped off here. I got extremely lucky and got a lift before the police came.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2013</description>

Turned out pretty great, though I didn&amp;#x27;t get a ride in 10 mins. More like 30. One thing, however, there is a gas station right on Linda Mar Blvd where this spot is posted on the map. The attendants saw my signs and made sure to tell me that &amp;quot;hichhiking is illegal in Pacifica&amp;quot; and I didnt want to deal with them calling the cops, so I walked down a little more where there is this huge dirt turnout and plenty of room for cars to stop. Took a ride to Santa Cruz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Curbcat (Hitchwiki), September 2012&lt;hr&gt;took free shuttle from SFSU to Dali City BART, then samtrans bus for a couple bucks and got dropped off right here. got a ride in 10 minutes. great way of leaving SF.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Direction: South/Lagos. Good spot, cars are not to fast because of the bridge. There is a small gas station, it&amp;#x27;s just for the cars of the municipality so there is no people to ask for a lift, but there is space for the cars to stop. It&amp;#x27;s good to have a sign Most of the cars are&amp;#x27;t going so far, but maybe you can ask for a lift just to the Aldi supermarket, it&amp;#x27;s a better spot to going south. Or you can walk. We got a ride in this place, so for us was good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2015</description>

            <description>We reach this place after a long hiking trip. We chosed keep walking instead of going back. I think we were pretty lucky to find a car from here. We took a ride to Ske. There was only one small village behind us. Head man of the village took us. If you really stuck, there is a small museum close to that area. The guy in there may help you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2016</description>

            <description>we were trying to reach mount etna from here in april 2004. the autobus takes you from the center of &amp;#x27;catania&amp;#x27; to &amp;#x27;nicolosi&amp;#x27; (the town where this marker is placed). from this spot you can hitchhike to the end of the road at the visitors center about 3 km close to the top of mount etna. we (3 persons) were waiting only a few minutes until someone took us. people are friendly as it is clear that you are a wanderer (meaning to have an interest in the geology). from &amp;#x27;nicolosi&amp;#x27; it should also be possible to hitchhike back to &amp;#x27;catania&amp;#x27;. on my personal rating from 1 (a very-very poor spot) to 10 (an excellent spot) this place receives  an &amp;#x27;7 to 8&amp;#x27;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>After crossing the border into Iran most likely there will be no car or truck (no private cars and very few trucks are crossing this border it seems), so you best walk to the next city Bajgiran - an easy 30 minutes downhill walk - and start to hitch from there. Not much traffic though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2014</description>

            <description>Not a review for a specific spot, but rather for the island of Zakynthos as a whole--easiest place to hitchhike I&amp;#x27;ve ever been. We hitched all over the island for 4 days and never had to wait more than 5 minutes. Just start walking in the direction of your destination and when a car comes by, smile and put out your thumb, usually the first car would stop, especially on the small roads between villages. Don&amp;#x27;t wait at a spot, just start walking, as cars will stop anywhere, even on narrow curves. Good to know some Greek. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 3 min, ride: 22 km ↖&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2023</description>

At first we (couple, late 20s) waited about 100m before that spot (in front of the A101 supermarket), but the cars go really fast, so they didn&amp;#x27;t have enough time to turn into the parking of the supermarket. A car finally stopped at the shoulder and we realised that (a) they stopped for us and (b) that the shoulder/bus stop would have been a much better place to HH from the very beginning. The two young guys took us almost until the Bafa Gölü lake, then tried to ask for a &amp;quot;road fee&amp;quot; with google translate but didn&amp;#x27;t persist when we said no. PS: we tried to do to Bodrum&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 25 min, ride: 37 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―TravelLightAndHike, September 2023</description>

            <description>We were staying there in three person. Two guys and one girl. It was so easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Duvik (Hitchwiki), September 2013&lt;hr&gt;Great point if you go to Antalya or Alanya. Very easily you can catch the car which goes directly to Antalya. I do not recommend you take a truck because on the way to Antalya there are a lot of mountains and with truck it will take more more time. Good luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2013</description>

            <description>It is really good spot with a lot of space and it&amp;#x27;s no far from the city but the most of the car are going to the villages on the way to Granada. But it is not a highway so you can accept shorter rides and than hitchike another car. For me it worked very well and I arrived to Granada after few hours,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ludmil (Hitchwiki), November 2016&lt;hr&gt;Crdoba-Granada. Get the bus number 6 from the center in direction to Barrio Guadalquivir and step out of the bus at the stop Carretera de Granada. Continue by foot for 100m. (Be aware that you are in the poorest suburb of Crdoba, show self-confidence). Then walk over the highway. There you can already show your cardboard. Continue straight for 300 m until the fuel station to your right. There you can start asking people. This national road involves a huge risk of getting stack in the middle at any of the crowded villages. Make sure that you get a direct ride to Granada, otherwise a very long one, or wait for the next. This road is mostly use by people of Baena, Alcal, or other villages in the way to Granada.

            <description>We tried to hitchhike to Granada on the carretera, and although the spot is not too bad in theory (either at the trafficlights 50m before the roundabout or at the roundabout), we waited 2 hours without finding a ride further than the closest villages. &lt;br&gt;In the end we took a bus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe try the petrol station 500m down the carretera, although we didn&amp;#x27;t want to walk that close on the street. And when we finally took the bus, there was not a single at the station. Anyway, maybe it was just bad luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2012</description>

The problem is that everybody who is going to Sevilla goes straight through the motor road (A-4).

In this spot is possible for the cars stop and you also can try to talk with the drivers.

            <description>Service area very close to the train station (Kaida). You can just walk around to the gate and walk straight in. Useful for escaping from Sendai (980 yen), and presumably a good way out of Fukushima too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2013</description>

            <description>Isthmus of Korinth/Canal of Korinth.&lt;br&gt;Good spot to visit the Canal of Korinth. Lot of traffic going to Athens and Patras .Seems as if a lot of cars/trucks leave the motorway (which is just a few hundred meters south of here) to avoid the toll gates.The Goody&amp;#x27;s restaurant has free WiFi and is open till midnight.

You might want to walk a bit in the direction you want to  go (West, North or South) before you start hitching.

I got a ride in the roundabout with a sing ( South direction ) and I got a ride to Almeria.. 
&lt;br&gt;

            <description>It was really easy to go out from the city by bus #44. It took us approx. 30 minutes to the hitchhiking spot. Notice that you have to push the stop button in the bus.

            <description>we were two (boy and girl) and hitchhiked almost on the roundabout. After 15 minutes we got a ride direct to Lisbon. (Monday afternoon after Easter). We had 2 signs (one with the name of our destination and the second sign with &amp;quot;Por favor&amp;quot;). A lot of drivers responded to it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2018&lt;hr&gt;We tried to hitchhike from here during the Sines Festival (fridayafternoon). But without any succes. So after some hours in the sun we gave up and took a bus instead. Sad. Cause we wanted to meet some locals... And cause we arrived way too late at our destination :-(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Evelyne (Hitchwiki), August 2015&lt;hr&gt;This is pretty much the only spot to get to Lisbon. We waited here for three hours and no one stopped. Try hitching here on Friday afternoon or Sunday evening when people are going to/from Lisbon. Or try shorter distance (Grandola or Setubal).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Terrible place. Only 1 car every 5-10 minutes, and even though they can see you from far, they are somehow incapable to grasp it might be useful to pick you up as you are stuck in the middle of nowhere. They do honk at you. It&amp;#x27;s also a dangerous place to stand and the shadowy spots are pretty sparse. I finally got picked up and dropped off at another junction about 30min by foot from the Segesta site. All in all, it took me between 4 and 5 hours to get from Castellamare to the ruins of Segesta (a 20min drive). Don&amp;#x27;t be stupid like me and just take the Tarantola bus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5, wait: 85 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―csillagkohó, June 2023</description>

            <description>I tried hitching to the ruins of Segesta here. Waited for over a literal hour. A lot of cars, often with 3 empty seats, pass by - either as local traffic, or ignoring you, or looking at you as if the concept of hitchhiking is completely alien and anthropologically fascinating to them, something they never saw a mortal do before. I finally got picked up, but only taken to an intersection even more in the middle of nowhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5, wait: 70 min, ride: 6 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―csillagkohó, June 2023</description>

After that time we decided to come back to Murcia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2019&lt;hr&gt;good option for direccion Valencia. If you want to go to Barcelona, try to find a lift that surpases Valencia or a lift that takes the paid highway following the coastline since people that go long distance to Barcelona are more likely to take this route.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Janpa (Hitchwiki), July 2013&lt;hr&gt;Have been here for over 12 hours. Getting lifts to Almeria are frequent but not many lorrys/cars head to Granada and it is impossible to get as far as Seville in one lift. we are a group of 3, however single travellers aiming for Granada will have more success as Spanish lorry drivers don&amp;#x27;t take the safety risk of no seats for passengers &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2013&lt;hr&gt;Take bus 36 to Santomera (instructions on wiki). You can get lifts in either direction, heading north/east is very easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>I wouldn&amp;#x27;t suggest trying to hitch North/East on I-80 after noon.  Many many commuters, tons of people laugh at you, thinking you&amp;#x27;re destitute or joking, I don&amp;#x27;t know.  It was a terrible feeling so much that I decided to quit thumbing after a couple hours and walk to another spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2014</description>

            <description>Just right after the roundabout it might be possible, but there are also many taxis and buses stopping. Better walk a couple of hundred meters to a traffic light. Hitch right after it, where there is enough space to stop for cars. Beware: this road is incredibly busy, and besides right after the roundabout or this traffic light there&amp;#x27;s no (i.e. zero) space for cars to stop. But don&amp;#x27;t worry, this is Iran and your &amp;quot;savior&amp;quot; is out there. I waited only 5 minutes but feared that I would have to wait for a long, long time. Not the best spot in my opinion - so take any car that gives you a lift...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tomtom (Hitchwiki), October 2014&lt;hr&gt;Hitchhing spot just wets of Maydan Azerbaijan.

            <description>Nice spot for going North or South on I-5, or West on Highway 12.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This place is real finicky! Make sure you LOOK and ACT your BEST!  There&amp;#x27;s tons of competition; including meth mouths asking for spare change (spangers) for &amp;quot;beer,&amp;quot; old school dead heads vying for gas money and other hitchhikers going all directions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Flying J, you can ask people directly for a lift.  I think having a sign is a good idea, so you can walk to the trucker&amp;#x27;s area to fly it.   Mind the Flying J managers.  They are nice, but don&amp;#x27;t want too many leeches on their property, so avoid the area if meth mouths and spangers are hovering in the area.  The police don&amp;#x27;t mind you if you look legit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;McDonald&amp;#x27;s nearby has free wifi.  There&amp;#x27;s an AMPM/Arco down the road that takes food stamps/ebt.  The Denny&amp;#x27;s is open 24 hours, so if you buy a coffee they won&amp;#x27;t mind you hanging around in there (but the wifi isn&amp;#x27;t free at Denny&amp;#x27;s!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2012</description>

            <description>Except for the empty and abandoned building, the police checkpoint doesn&amp;#x27;t exist anymore (August 2014). But at least you can still sit there in the shade of the building&amp;#x27;s walls and wait for a ride (that will come at one point - be optimistic!). BTW: The spot is a 30 minute walk from the bridge in Murghab. I had to wait three hours for the first(!) car to pass, which brought me to Alichur. There I had luck with a Chinese truck (waiting time maybe 30 minutes), which drove all the way to the truck terminal 20 kilometers away from Khorog. There, hitching further is no problem any more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tomtom (Hitchwiki), August 2014&lt;hr&gt;Here is police checkpoint located. Nice place to spend some time. Police guys will invite you to chat, share some food and let you sleep if you do not want to sleep outside on the wind. Then police guys will ask every passing car to drive you to Khorog. So cool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2013</description>

            <description>Same as in Langar, start your way early. 6-7am is good. Traffic is very low, like 1 car per 1-2h.

            <description>Probably the best spot to hitchhike out of Messina but still not a good spot. There are some place for the cars to stop but not so much and lots of cars cant see you because of a fence.

            <description>Just landed in Izmir and need a ride south? You can start HHing at the airport. Even taxi drivers may help you and take you until the Izmir-Aydin road. There you can start HHing south; however solo woman travelers should beware as there are women waiting at the side of that road (Izmir-Aydin road heading south), you can be mistaken. You can also HH if you&amp;#x27;re going to the city centre but there is a metro station at the airport, which is a cheap option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2014</description>

&lt;br&gt;Do not even try to ask them with english ..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5, wait: 200 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Imadielity, July 2023</description>

            <description>Good spot to get in direction Aydin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I waited about 20-30 minutes until I got picked up. Cars can pull over quite easily, because there is a big space at the right side. There is lots of traffic from 3 directions, but for some of the cars it might be hard to see you as they are just turning there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also Cesme might be possible, but they tend stay on the left side of the road which might make it a little harder for them to pull over on the right side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2012</description>

It was a Tuesday afternoon in March but we got picked up in about 20 minutes and got a ride all the way past Eureka to Arcata!

There are many university students who commute between Izmir and Manisa this way and it&amp;#x27;s a usual spot for people to pick you up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Canaydemir (Hitchwiki), January 2014&lt;hr&gt;Cars go especially Manisa but you can find Balıkesir also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Kemaleksi (Hitchwiki), September 2013&lt;hr&gt;To Manisa, Balkesir, Bursa, stanbul&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2012</description>

            <description>To anywhere except Iran.&lt;br&gt;There are many dolmu and buses driving quite far out of the city on the main road.

            <description>It&amp;#x27;s not easy to HH here as most of the cars who stop for you will be cars. Try to explain them where you are going and that you are travelling without money/paying (there is no word for HHing in Iran and it&amp;#x27;s not a known concept). People are friendly, so a taxi going east can take you free of charge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2014</description>

            <description>Avoid hitching west out of Sacramento by taking a Yolo Transit bus to Davis, and walking here, across the street from the In &amp;amp; Out Burger. For maximum visibility, stand on the triangular traffic island. Cars have plenty of room to stop. If you&amp;#x27;d like a ride all the way to the East Bay, an &amp;quot;East Bay&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Oakland&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;BART&amp;quot; sign can help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2011</description>

            <description>Moab is the absolutel best for hitchin&amp;#x27;!!!! Loads of friendly adventurers around the area, tourists, free camping all over the place (incl along the river!), locals are cool too, walking 191 in any direction is a great walk along with great views, before some friendly person picks you up. and if you&amp;amp;they cool perhaps you&amp;#x27;ll get picked up on some sweet adventure! ;o) it&amp;#x27;s an amazing place, a good one to take out of the box.

            <description>Arrived 20.12.2017. Basically all local traffic towards Setubal or south. Not a lot traffic on a Wednesday afternoon. Senseless to go East towards Spain. Better stay at previous one closer to Lisbon if heading Spain. In my opinion if you&amp;#x27;re heading south you might get a chance here, although most of the traffic just head to Setabul or around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2017&lt;hr&gt;Not a big amount of traffic on this gas station, but it&amp;#x27;s definitely a good place to hitch rides direction Algarve.

Only a small fence separates the road you take from the station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), April 2016&lt;hr&gt;There is a petrol station at both sides.

Just ring the bell and the gate will open. Not a good spot for long distances but you can get further on the highway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 45 min, ride: 26 km →&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Sebby, September 2023&lt;hr&gt;Well, I was unable to find an easy way to get in, so had to walk around to Western side, climb a fence, enter a highway and RUN 150 m as fast as I can.&lt;br&gt;Hitchability is rather poor, I was going in a direction of Spain, but most of the cars are occupied by local families and those who are not doesn&amp;#x27;t go far. Found a ride to one of the next gas stations in an hour and a half, assume it to be a better option for going Spain despite being a bit deserted.&lt;br&gt;P.S. reached this station to witness two German guys going south standing with a sign at the exit since morning. Poor boys continued their efforts as I was leaving. Just something to consider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2019&lt;hr&gt;Arrived 20.12.2017, not a lot traffic and a lot of them head south. Try from here hitchhiking to A6, 1 hour asking and waiting a local took me to the next station before Setubal and I got stuck there. Only go on a ride when you actually head to A6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fence is not a problem you can climb the wall right after the tunnel from train station.&lt;br&gt;Generally it&amp;#x27;s not the best but does work to hitch to east or south &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2017&lt;hr&gt;Got a ride after 15 minutes to Portimao, pretty easy. You just have to ask people directly while they are refueling. By the way, if you see the gate closed then you just have to ring the bell and the gate will open. Simple as that, you don&amp;#x27;t have to jump the fence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2016&lt;hr&gt;So partly I was unlucky because 1 minute after I arrived (alone, female) one other hitchhiker came and then two more (a couple)! Also it took a while to find a way around the extensive fencing which surrounds this place. They&amp;#x27;ve mended a bunch of holes that were made. Bring cutters or just after you pass under the highway (from the train station) climb up the wall and around the end of the fence. The 3 others who were there took the best hitching spot (all wanted to socialise and smoke weed?!?) so I took a different strategy: asking people directly &amp;quot;vais para sul?&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Going south?&amp;quot;) Some people were nice but there are a lot of families and also assholes coming through this place. I found out it&amp;#x27;s the most expensive place to buy petrol. So maybe we should all seek a better hitching spot next time. It costs €4,50 to arrive by metro/train from Lisbon centre. I waited for 4 hours and was finally was picked up by a nice local lady who offered to take me to a train station. I took it because I was sun burnt and had a deadline to arrive at my destination. The other 3 people were still waiting. Definitely not a top HH experience here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Avocadocity (Hitchwiki), July 2015&lt;hr&gt;February 2015. After around 15 minutes of asking around, we found a ride to Beja. The deivers, however, were going to lunch, so we decided to look around more and luckily after some 15 minutes more we found a drivet going to Tavira!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), April 2015&lt;hr&gt;With a friend (1 girl+1 guy) we waited here something more than 1 hour until a guy took us to a service station further on A-6. Asked a lot of people around, varied our signs a lot. I think the best sign is if you write &amp;quot;A6 East&amp;quot; or something like this, because lot of people don&amp;#x27;t go very far from here. But be aware, because on service stations further ahead there can be almost no traffic during certain hours of the day!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Besnik19 (Hitchwiki), September 2014&lt;hr&gt;I waited for longer than 4 hours asking everyone I saw to go to Algarve. Mostly everyone was staying around the area or as furthest they would go to Alentejo. There weren&amp;#x27;t so many stopping by though. After all the time finally someone picked me up straight to Portimao, but still wasn&amp;#x27;t that good like others said&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2014&lt;hr&gt;Used it three times, 15min - lagos,15min - faro ,4h(two guys) - sevilla&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Bur (Hitchwiki), January 2014&lt;hr&gt;Got a ride after half an hour almost all the way down to Algarve (no Portuguese, just English).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2012&lt;hr&gt;waited only one hour there and my portuguese is more or less not existing! just ask the people, someone will take you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;to enter, just go through the gate. in my case it was closed and nobody opend, so go 50m back in direction to the trainstation and you&amp;#x27;ll find a small hole in the fence. tadaaa, there you go!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2012&lt;hr&gt;not the best spot for a ride to spain since most of the drivers heading south to Algarve or Setubal. You need to ask many people until you&amp;#x27;re like. so far i haven&amp;#x27;t found a better spot, so it&amp;#x27;s for the moment probably the best option for direction Badajoz/Spain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Wukk (Hitchwiki), March 2012&lt;hr&gt;if you ask people you will get a ride very quickly, since the most portuguese speak english!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Irazall (Hitchwiki), September 2011&lt;hr&gt;good spot. we got a ride after 1,5 hours from there to madrid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2011&lt;hr&gt;i also had to wait there 6 hours, and sleep there, and next day more 6 hours. I asked a ride from everybody who arrived, but some of them went just to Setúbal, others fraid of us. Two guys in 2010.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2011&lt;hr&gt;Extremely easy to get to and then all you have to do is talk to people to get a ride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Mdsmendes (Hitchwiki), January 2011&lt;hr&gt;I stood for 8+ hours and then gave up, first time in my h-hiking practice&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Siberian explorer (Hitchwiki), December 2010&lt;hr&gt;When heading South of Lisbon or towards Spain. Take the train to Foros de Amora and then cross under the highway to get at this gas station. Here you can ask people to take you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>If you are HHing from Izmir to Ankara (or vice versa), you may be dropped off here by a driver going towards Kutahya. If you&amp;#x27;re HHing in Ankara direction, it is better to avoid cars going only until Usak to avoid entering the centre of the city and walking outside. It is a good HHing spot, so you can wait until you find a car that is going further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2014</description>

            <description>I have to say that this was my worst experience doing hitchhiking here. A couple of brothers thought that it would be good idea to get a lift in this &amp;quot;Peaje&amp;quot; because a lot of drivers pass through it and from this place, is the only way to go to Alicante. It was in summer when I did it, and there are a lot of English people who own a summer house in that region of Spain. Reach people with fancy cars who won&amp;#x27;t even think in the possibility to give you a ride. It was a little bit late when I started to ask for a lift, but my hope ended up at midnight because nobody stopped. I was hungry but there’s no store or restaurant near there. I started to look for a place to sleep and I speeded the night on the pavement of a road. I’m in shock after this situation. I just can’t believe how selfish and indifferent can the people be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tavo S. (Hitchwiki), August 2016&lt;hr&gt;Unfortunately this &amp;quot;Peaje&amp;quot; is your only chance to get to the highway. Avoid this place. It took us hours to get a ride to Alicante. There are some good tomatoes and grapes around, however. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>I can&amp;#x27;t say that it is a great place anymore since they installed a camera on the parking plot. From my own experience, they spotted me and in 10minutes, a car went specially to bid me to go away. Motive : no hitch-hiking on the highway and the parking plot is part of the highway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2012&lt;hr&gt;If you want to head South of Lisbon you can start here. You will depend on people stopping for you only. As far as that goes it&amp;#x27;s a great place!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

(15th June 2014)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), December 2014&lt;hr&gt;a lot of people  will stop very quick, but be sure where you want to go, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2014&lt;hr&gt;Btw, that was in summer 2013. in August.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Kwabena (Hitchwiki), January 2014&lt;hr&gt;Very very BAD spot! First, because cars that stop there are from neighborhoods from left and right of that gas station, and most important - if cars want to go on highway north of Lisbon from that place, they can&amp;#x27;t go straight north, but have to go on &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; way ABOVE hightway (like 50m from gas station), then BACK towards centre of Lisbon some 1km, then again on &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; way above highway to return on the direction for north! That means, people who are going north are NOT STOPPING at that station, unless they made a mistake. I waited 6 hours, and two Polish guys I met there waited 12H!! I had luck with some French couple who made mistake and stopped there. Also, some Portuguese people told me that I have to be careful at that gas station cuz it&amp;#x27;s in bad neighborhood, but to be honest, I didn&amp;#x27;t see anything suspicious.. Good luck!    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Kwabena (Hitchwiki), January 2014&lt;hr&gt;very good spot although many cars instead of going north just return to Lisboa ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2013&lt;hr&gt;good spot. traffic is mostly local/regional though, therefore we took a lift to the next service area at the A1 called &amp;quot;aveiras&amp;quot;. There it was no problem to find a lift going further north.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Momsen (Hitchwiki), July 2012&lt;hr&gt;good spot, i use it often. waiting time can go from 10 min to 2 hours..! anyway prepare to ask a lot of people, as many drivers are not going to the A1 motorway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ratodoporao (Hitchwiki), June 2012&lt;hr&gt;Good spot. No worries, also it seems that the road splits 50 metres before the gas station, there is a possibilty for cars to directly enter the highway again after it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Poebbels (Hitchwiki), February 2012&lt;hr&gt;great spot right before the highway and easily reach with public transportation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Mdsmendes (Hitchwiki), January 2011&lt;hr&gt;If you want to head north of Lisbon this is the place to start! Ask to head towards Highway A1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>The only time i tried, I got a ride after 10min to the first gas station in the A8, so it felt like a good spot. It&amp;#x27;s super easy to reach: take the metro (yellow line) to &amp;quot;Senhor Roubado&amp;quot; and walk 5min. If other people have more experiences here please post! kiko&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ratodoporao (Hitchwiki), April 2014&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will write this on the very beginning, for the warning of the future hitchhikers- this place is hopeless, I was waiting here for an hour on one day (before the sun went down) and then for sth like 5 hours the next day. The drivers here are circulating around Lisbon only, there is nobody going further north in the direction of Leiria... &lt;br&gt;But just in case somebody would feel like having adventure, to get here you must take the Green metro line to Campo Grande, then change for a bus 36 towards Odivelas. Get off at Cç. Carriche / Estr. Desvio bus stop, then go for 2 minutes, you will reach Galp petrol station...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2011</description>

            <description>Afyon is in the crossroads of big cities. What&amp;#x27;s nice here is that the main road does not go through the city, so you don&amp;#x27;t have to walk a lot. There is a crossing and a bridge somewhere around here and many cars go to Ankara. There are also a lot of way stations in Afyon, so you can check the licence plates and ask the drivers personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2014</description>

            <description>The main problem of this spot seems to me to be that the kind of people driving by are doing short distance rides  and don&amp;#x27;t seem to want to stop for someone they don&amp;#x27;t know. But there are also nice and interesting persons willing to stop and, luckily, they&amp;#x27;ll get you directly to Lisbon! So it really depends on your luck. The road has many crosspoints, so be sure you&amp;#x27;re in the correct one, whether you want to go to Lisbon or the Cascais part.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2013</description>

            <description>I (female) stood for less than 10 minutes here on a Monday and got picked up by a trucker. There is plenty of traffic going direction Spain, a bit hard for big trucks to stop at the speed (easy for cars), like mine did, but there is plenty of room for them to pull over!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2015</description>

            <description>To get onto I-66W. If you take the 640 bus from Vienna metro stop it drops you close to here, and it&amp;#x27;s the only spot that makes sense. But it&amp;#x27;s pretty terrible - tiny amount of time for drivers to see you and very little space to stop. I did get a ride, but it was pure luck. Hitching just outside of Vienna metro seems like a better idea, plus you don&amp;#x27;t have to pay or wait for the bus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2014</description>

            <description>Waited there for like an hour till I got a hike 70km outside Lisbon. I &amp;#x27;d say its a good spot cause there are many portuguese shopping in the mall that&amp;#x27;s there. I imagine I would have gotten a hike sooner, or better but it was 7:30 in the afternoon of a Sunday. :/ Shit happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―LowInertia (Hitchwiki), April 2014&lt;hr&gt;some space on the side lane for cars to stop; it was good to get to Mrida, direction Madrid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2012</description>

IT TOOK ME 7 HOURS to catch a ride near this place to the north&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Sergi1991 (Hitchwiki), July 2015&lt;hr&gt;If you re going north (Coimbra, Porto etc), a friendly advice, DONT GO THERE! IF SOMEBODY OFFERS TO TAKE YOU TO A SERVICE AREA NEAR ALVERCA SAY NO! WORST PLACE EVER. I m not exaggerating, it really took me 6 hours to get a hike and it could have easily gotten me more if it werent for a nice trucker that showed mercy.&lt;br&gt;The roundabout 1km ahead is also senseless. Really. Dont even bother. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2014</description>

            <description>90% of cars are Taxi&amp;#x27;s or people wanting money. Roads are very twisty and mountainous, not great for trucks.

            <description>Plenty of cars, but most of the traffic is local. The Portuguese ones go mainly just to Elvas. &lt;br&gt;We were tempted to hitch to the gas station on the other side of the border or to Elvas and try our luck there, but later realized that it wouldn&amp;#x27;t be a good solution, it&amp;#x27;s so deserted there.&lt;br&gt;It took us around 1,5h to get a ride straight to Lisbon by the nacional. If you go further than just across the border, better to stick to this place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), May 2016&lt;hr&gt;Last gaz station before border.

            <description>Its a really good spot to go to north - carceres etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Brittata (Hitchwiki), July 2014&lt;hr&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a good spot to go in direction of Sevilla, or maybe Madrid. But it&amp;#x27;s really not the best to stop if you&amp;#x27;re going in direction of Portugal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Remigr (Hitchwiki), January 2014&lt;hr&gt;The best spot in this region to start a mid-long trip in many different directions: Portugal, north of Spain, Seville or Madrid. If you are in the city, you can do all the way to the spot walking. It won&amp;#x27;t be more than 5 km. But if you aren&amp;#x27;t on the mood, you can take the bus. Buses 7 and 8 lead  to &amp;quot;Avenida de pitagoras&amp;quot;. Then go to the west and ask for the path &amp;quot;Calle del Palo&amp;quot; (it isn&amp;#x27;t on this map, but it exist). At the end of this way you can find two big petrol stations where you can ask for any direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2012</description>

            <description>Went there and retuned back to İzmir via hitch-hiking for a day-trip. Also it was one of my stops when I was going to İstanbul. It is very crowd road and nice spots to catch cars just after the traffic lights. However, wasnot so fast to get one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Luneris (Hitchwiki), May 2012&lt;hr&gt;My worst experience in Turkey, I waited here 4 hours. Also some of my friend waited longer.&lt;br&gt;It seems like a perfect place. Many cars using this road. I would avoid this place next time. Maybe my dark hair and beard cause this...:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2010</description>

            <description>One of the best hitching spots I&amp;#x27;ve ever seen! The homie at the gas station (Papa Joe&amp;#x27;s stop and go) Gary is the absolute man, super friendly to let me stay outside and ask for rides. and there&amp;#x27;s even streetlights at the corners of the onramps so you can get rides at night!!! Lots of rides headed toward Grand Junction &amp;amp; Salt Lake... Many people making the long-distance trip home from Moab so I even turned down a few rides to GJ to get one all the way to Glenwood Springs. Travel Strong homies!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Wavydavy (Hitchwiki), November 2016&lt;hr&gt;It&amp;#x27;s just desert, nothing else, but there is a place on the other side of the interstate where you can get water and food. You won&amp;#x27;t starve. People going to Moab give you a ride pretty easily. Waited just 20 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2013</description>

            <description>This may be useful if you&amp;#x27;re going to Lisbon at work days. Otherwise AVOID. I was unlucky to be lifted there while going to Madrid on Saturday. Absolutely pointless: gave up asking (after unsuccessfuly asking everyone at the spot), went to highway exit (nice point, much place to stop and slow traffic), find out that the traffic is extremely rare (one car/10-15 mins, lorries being very few of them). Luck sent me Portuguese guys with a direct ride to Madrid suburbs at the moment I was considering taking a bus (they say there is a stop nearby). Little bit less than 3h of waiting under the burning sun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2019&lt;hr&gt;If you go to Madrid or Lisbon, it&amp;#x27;s the very useful place - many tracks stops here. So, just ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2014</description>

            <description>Not too much traffic, but you&amp;#x27;re outside of the city and past where 275 breaks off, so people are more likely to be heading a long direction. Wait time was around 45 minutes to an hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2012</description>

            <description>Good place to get rides on I-81, both south and north. There&amp;#x27;s a Liberty gas station, with a few trucks. Stand with a sign in the station&amp;#x27;s exit or ask around with drivers. If you came on I-66 to I-81 south, and the driver was going north, this is a good option to get the next ride south. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2014</description>

            <description>I&amp;#x27;m not exactly sure it was that spot, but this mark supposed to be for the place where you can go to walk to the salt. there are many people passing by, also for the lake, so it took 10 minute to get picked up. there is no shadow tho, and if it happens that you have to sleep around, better to go up to the hills, because by the side of the lake there were many-many big streetdogs appearing after sunset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2016</description>

            <description>We were left here by the driver in the evening and couldn&amp;#x27;t find a lift in more then 2 hours so we had to sleep on the station. Next day after 3 hours of waiting we found an excellent lift to Belgrade! But we were lucky, this station is terrible and avoid it! No buses, no villages near by, only way to get out is autostop which is not working well in this place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2014</description>

            <description>There is a lot of space for cars to stop and they can see you from a reasonable distance. 
&lt;br&gt;You don’t really have to go this far to get out of the city but I thought it would be better.

            <description>Hitchhiking north out of Sacramento is a challenge, but for four dollars, one can catch a bus on J street up to this intersection in Yuba City. Stand at the corner of Hwy 20 and Hwy 99, where much of the 99&amp;#x27;s northbound traffic will have to stop or slow down at the traffic light. Plenty of room for cars or trucks to pull over.

            <description>A small gas station with not a lot of traffic and many people don&amp;#x27;t go far. Nonetheless, there are some tourists on this route and we (2) ended up finding a ride within 30 minutes or so to Murcia (could have gone further to Cartagena and continued the next day with them to Málaga).
&lt;br&gt;In the end we decided to visit Málaga and take a BlaBlaCar from there.
&lt;br&gt;The A7 is challenging to hitch-hike, because there are very very few service stations. If there are any, they are often off the highway. Had we not found a ride straight to Murcia, I think we might have been stuck there.
&lt;br&gt;However, if you want to go further (Granada, Málaga), try to find a ride that takes you at least to Granada. This will be hard to find, but probably worth it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 30 min 💬, ride: 175 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―kar10house, May 2024</description>

In the end i got rescued by germans with big old trucks who were searching everywhere for strong air pump for their wheels. If you have a chance to go to next station near Massalaves, go there, it looked much more promissing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5, wait: 180 min, ride: 153 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Alpazel, February 2024&lt;hr&gt;Very nice place to find a ride to Murcia or Granada or any direction South! I truck took me to murcia.

&lt;br&gt;You can arrive here by train or doing Autostop from Valencia. Just 20 km away from Valencia.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 5 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2023</description>

            <description>Good spot to go to the south, just before entering the highway. There is a gas station where there are a lot of trucks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 90 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Yelo, December 2023&lt;hr&gt;I found a truck directly to Murcia, also here it&amp;#x27;s a good spot for a ride to any direction South!!!

More options if you want to head toward Daimiel, Ciudad Real or Crdoba, less if you want to head south on the A4. The attendant at the station was helpful (but didn&amp;#x27;t speak English).

Make sure you walk past the hospital and the gas station as many drivers either turn back around or stop at the gas station.

            <description>It took us about an hour to find a ride here. We tried both, standing with a sign at the road and asking around at the gas station. In the end, asking around worked, but there is a lot of local traffic! Try to find somebody to get you onto the highway, then take it from there.
&lt;br&gt;Standing with a sign didn&amp;#x27;t work at all for us. Cars are very fast and it&amp;#x27;s hard for them to stop. I think it can work, but probably the gas station is the safer way to find a ride. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 60 min 💬, ride: 44 km ↙&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―kar10house, May 2024&lt;hr&gt;The first one I asked took me to Alcoi, from there it was quite difficult to hitch further towards Murcia. While I asked the first driver a worker of the gas station came to me and told me that I should not ask drivers at the station and pointed me to some places to try with a sign. Luckily the driver already agreed to take me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―LukasR (Hitchwiki), April 2015&lt;hr&gt;Check which road your driver is taking.

            <description>I used that spot to go to Alcuéscar, a town between Cáceres and Mérida. A lot of people pass by but they drive fast and it isn&amp;#x27;t a very good place to stop the car. One disadvantage is that is that you have to walk for one hour from the city center. Local people caught me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Pabloml (Hitchwiki), July 2016&lt;hr&gt;Actually i use that spot just to go to Badajoz, it is very close. There isn&amp;#x27;t too much long-traffic on this road so if you want to go to Sevilla, it will be better to go to Merida (you can use the bus, it is very cheap ~4€ ) and take a better spot there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Iwan1989 (Hitchwiki), December 2012&lt;hr&gt;A good place to wait to go to Sevilla from Caceres.

            <description>A man took me here from Castelo Branco, he was very kind but this is not a very logical waiting spot towards Lisbon.
&lt;br&gt;Foggy day, 2 hours of daylight left, i waited on this narrow provincial road to Gavião/Abrantes with curious cows staring at me, then realized the nearby bigger road goes also to Abrantes, tried to walk but darkness and cars driving fast made it unsafe. So after a total of 3 hours, i came back to this spot and walked in the dark, intermittent torch on my hand. The third car stopped and took me to Abrantes train station (7:30pm last one).
&lt;br&gt;Thank you torch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 180 min, ride: 46 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―GiovanniTonucci, January 2024</description>

            <description>We have been 2 girls, hitchiking during Semana santa to the Madrid. Lots of people had full car, because of holidays, so it was harder to find ride to Madrid.

It was at the end of the summer, maybe in winter it&amp;#x27;s not possible to cross the river. The advantage of that spot if you come from Barcelona in the highway you can ask to your driver to drop you here because it&amp;#x27;s posible to go back to A7 direction south or to the inside of valencia city. It will take just 5 minuts. Moreover if you come from madrid you can get of here to reaches Valencia if it&amp;#x27;s needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2013</description>

This spot is to get stucked in the village of the mountains, bad idea when you&amp;#x27;ve just arrived with the ferry (common choice I&amp;#x27;d say, cause I did !).

Otherwise it might be a good spot for other directions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2011</description>

            <description>April 2022. After a whole year travelling across Turkey and learning how to become a nomad while waiting for Iranian border to re-open as well as escaping pandemic, after a whole winter in Georgia. Finally i came again to Doğubeyazıt and got a relaxing ride by a truck. I was so excited and speechless that i even fell asleep on the way to Gürbülak. You have to leave the car and walk through the border, that&amp;#x27;s quicker. I found the same truck on the other side and they hosted me in Marand.

Drivers was responding here and traffic was good but there was three of us and many of them went to Porto direction. We been there for half an hour when FedEx car stopped at the crossing of the two roads and created little chaos in the traffic, me and my sister got ride and our friend was stayed there for more 5 minutes on his own. We get to Lisbon in 45 minutes!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Eoin (Hitchwiki), September 2015&lt;hr&gt;Good spot to hitchhike from Fatima.

            <description>If your car goes to Barcelona and you want to go further (North), ask the driver to drop you off in the big gas station (Porta de Barcelona). Then ask truck drivers, perfect place to go to France!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Amede74 (Hitchwiki), January 2015&lt;hr&gt;Very good place, worth the treck! Got a lift to Barcelona after 2min!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More precision: Take the train from Station Nord (around 20min, 2.65euro), then once arrived in Puzol ask the roundabout (redonda) on the &amp;quot;carretera de Barcelona&amp;quot;, here you have a supermarket, go behing and follow the small road close to the orange trees that lead you to the bridge. Follow the road under the bridge, so you will arrive on the other side of the &amp;quot;autovia&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;autopista&amp;quot; (dont be afraid even if you going North), then walk around 2km, you will pass a bridge above the highway (you will see the petrol station), just after the bridge turn left to follow the path between the highway and the orange trees. Here you are! The guy who discover this is a genius, thanks a lot! around 40min walking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: if your Spanish is not so good, precise that you want to go to the petrol station of the highway (autopista) and not the one of the &amp;quot;autovia&amp;quot; (free road). In Puzol it is hard to know where you have to go at the beginning, there is a lot of road with bridge, so it is confusing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Amede74 (Hitchwiki), January 2015&lt;hr&gt;Good place, I got a lift directly to Barcelona.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Iwan1989 (Hitchwiki), December 2014&lt;hr&gt;Do not confuse it with the petrol station in V23.  Take a look at the map.The path(normal street) is exactly after you meet the juntion with the highway(you are under it) on the left. At the end there is no street, you see the huge station on your left side, you cross the oranges fields and you jump over the fence. Really great spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Alexan (Hitchwiki), April 2013&lt;hr&gt;A very good place. cars driving directly to Italy. Go around and talk with people.

            <description>The main description above is fairly accurate, except the first road at the supermarket stops being the CV-306 and becomes the CV-3007. Turn left directly after the autovia exit, follow the small road, but when the road joins another road, turn left about 200 metres after.

Here is a cheap supermarket. Go on north on CV306. Pass under a bridge, go on 50m where is a small road on the left with a &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; sign. Take it. On the righ side you have orange trees of Els arenas (with a little little swimming pool). The road takes you under a second bridge, than you go on 2km north along the highway on the left and mandarine and orange orchards on the right until you get to the Sagunt station.&lt;br&gt;Circa 40 minutes of walking (with supermarket and oranges, mandarines, cactus fruit, figs - depending on a season).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Description is based on Amede74&amp;#x27;s note and Seminko&amp;#x27;s experience)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2015</description>

            <description>Finally! Took about 2 hours and 3 different spots, but here we got a ride to Platamon. Best to walk here instead of the gas station if going direction Thessaloniki, because about half cars turn right here and go to villages, so you avoid those and only get the ones going far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 60 min, ride: 40 km ↗&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2023</description>

            <description>In 2013 me and my girlfriend passed all Pamir Highway only with h-hiking. It possible but still takes a lot of time. Use police checkpoints to get a lift for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Siberian explorer (Hitchwiki), September 2014&lt;hr&gt;Exactly, unpredictable. I waited five minutes (paid some money though - you have to be really lucky to get a lift for free), a pair of hitchhikers I met later in Murghab told me they waited for four hours... So you never know. In one day I counted around ten cars in the direction Murghab-Sary Tash. Probably less in the other direction (this was in the beginning of August 2014)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tomtom (Hitchwiki), August 2014&lt;hr&gt;Traffic is around 15 cars in a day here. Totally unpredictible spot. I had waited 30 min and then h-hiked to Bordobo checkpoint with borderguards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Siberian explorer (Hitchwiki), October 2013&lt;hr&gt;To Murgab: From Sary Tash town, walk down the towards Tajikistan, the road splits at a police stop. Wait there for cars going left towards the snowy mountains. Alot of trucks from China to Tajikistan no longer go through here and hitchhiking (for free) is incredibly difficult. Even for paid transport to Murgab, waiting times are long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2013</description>

            <description>The worst place ever. At first when I wanted to start catching at paeje, a worker came to me and said that i couldn&amp;#x27;t hitchhike there and sugested me to go to lawn next to toll building. But after half an hour of catching another  worker came and said that he was calling the police. So I&amp;#x27;d to change my plans for that day. Sagunto is much better option. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2012&lt;hr&gt;If you are anywhere within the Valencia Cercanias area, including Gandia or even Castelleon (even going north!), please take the train to Les Valls and use this spot. From the station, walk a few hundred metres over the bridge and down the dirt road, pick an orange, before climbing over the fence. Hold out a sign for France, Barcelona, or for south, Murcia, Alicante, wherever... This place works day and night, and guarantees you a much faster ride on the AP-7 instead of waiting hours elsewhere for a ride on the N-340!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Perfect spot! Nice and wide road and cars go slow. Here you can find a truck going to Iran or even further, like Turkmenistan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2014</description>

            <description>We were really lucky with our Trabzon sign and got a ride almost to Erzincan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Paul (Hitchwiki), July 2016&lt;hr&gt;Direction east. There is plenty of space for cars to pull over and a lot of traffic (even though a lot of it is local). If you use a sign make sure to choose a couple places close to eachother and not just your end destination as far-bound traffic is rare (my sign said Erzurum and it took me 2 hours to find a ride, so write Zara and from there use Erzincan and then Erzurum).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2014</description>

            <description>Southbound. This seemed like an ideal spot; lots of traffic, wide ramp, stoplight. My experience here was pretty terrible. I had a few offers of rides two to three miles down the road and nothing else for nearly five hours. I finally left when a cop threatened me, even though I was standing in a legal spot. If heading to the bay, I&amp;#x27;d suggest taking the bus over to I-5.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2012</description>

            <description>Had no luck hitching other exits wast of here in Aurora. Apparently there are a few prisons around and signs sayiing not to pick up hitchhikers. Finally got picked up by  a creepy old dude who told me about his gay experiences. Asked what kind of work I do, implying sex. got a ride out to a loves 20 miles out at least. But beware he drives around a lot looking for hitchhikers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2015</description>

            <description>I was going to Lisbon and came here from Castelo Branco northern district by Linha Azul bus (1€). You should drop off before this road intersection, you&amp;#x27;ll have to walk back longer otherwise.
&lt;br&gt;I waited on the western side of this previously pinned point, facing Schreiber (look at the map).
&lt;br&gt;After 20 minutes a spanish expat living in Coimbra picked me up. He&amp;#x27;s one of the many drivers avoiding the nearby highway. He dropped me near Vila Velha de Rodao where the road to Coimbra begins northwards. It was hard to leave that mentioned place, as no car enters the highway to Lisbon. So if you&amp;#x27;re here in Castelo Branco, make sure your driver doesn&amp;#x27;t take you to a village. Or choose a highway entrance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 20 min, ride: 30 km ↙&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―GiovanniTonucci, January 2024&lt;hr&gt;Large sidewalk, in front of a gas station. DIrections Lisbon and Guarda.&lt;br&gt;It has an hardware and gardening store really close, so the drivers can pull over at the shops entrance to pick you up.&lt;br&gt;We were going to Nisa wich is a small village and we waited for 40 minutes max.&lt;br&gt;I noticed it also serves the people who live in the outskirts of Castelo Branco, so probably lots of people will tell you they&amp;#x27;re staying in town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2014</description>

            <description>To go direction Eskiehir, take the bus 121 from Kzlay direction Turkuaz-Toki (bus stop along Atatrk Bulvar, around 100 m down from Gven Parki before a bridge above the main street). It&amp;#x27;s a long ride, at some point you&amp;#x27;ll see the signs direction Istanbul (highway), pass them and after that point you can get off anywhere.

            <description>Toll gate - excellent spot for rides south towards Xian. It&amp;#x27;s a popular hitchhiking spot I guess, so staff and highway police are used to these strange foreigners on the highway ;-). To get here take the metro (Line 14) to Yuanboyuan station (Garden Expo Park - Exit C). From here it&amp;#x27;s around 1.5 kilometer walk to Dujiakan Roundabout and the ramp-on to the highway, where there are the toll gates. Alternatively take any bus which goes along Yuanbo Ave. to&lt;br&gt;Dujiakan Roundabout.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2014</description>

            <description>Departure spot mainly to north (Fundao, Covilha) and you can also be offered Lisbon as destination, despite indications to it being on the entrance by the other side of the bridge and a more suitable way starts in Castelo Branco Sul (southern highway entrance). After 30 minutes they offered me Lisbon, then i had to wait one more hour to Alcains where a dutch expat dropped me towards the countryside. In case you get stuck in the afternoon you can opt for provincial buses to north by &amp;quot;Quinta da danca&amp;quot; stop 10 minutes away (walk Espanha direction then get down the bridge). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 90 min, ride: 27 km ↑&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―giovanniTonucci, November 2023</description>

            <description>Don&amp;#x27;t think this is a good spot for hitching towards Istanbul. You are right on the highway (not straight here either!) and cars go very fast. It seems most cars are just using the ring road, but not leaving town. I had three different lifts just to get towards the toll station. Very tricky. It&amp;#x27;s probably better starting in Susuz (north of Ankara) - but couldn&amp;#x27;t find information on how to get there. Btw: the dolmuş to &amp;quot;Yaşamkent&amp;quot; (45 minutes at least) leaves from the west side of Güvenpark, which is close to Kizilay metro station. Couldn&amp;#x27;t find bus 123, which is mentioned on the Ankara page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tomtom (Hitchwiki), October 2014&lt;hr&gt;A good spot for Istanbul which can be reached with one bus only from the center. Take a bus or a dolmu to &amp;quot;Yaamkent&amp;quot; which is the last neighborhood before the highway. Ask the driver and get off as soon as he leaves the main road. From there walk up to the highway. There is no paytol, you can just stand on the road side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2011</description>

            <description>The Khor Virap (Armenian:  , meaning &amp;quot;deep pit&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;deep well&amp;quot;) is an Armenian Apostolic Church monastery located in the Ararat plain in Armenia, near the border with Turkey, about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of Artashat, Ararat Province. The monastery was host to a theological seminary and was the residence of Armenian Catholicos.&lt;br&gt;Khor Virap&amp;#x27;s notability as a monastery and pilgrimage site is attributed to the fact that Grigor Lusavorich, who later became Saint Gregory the Illuminator, was initially imprisoned here for 14 years by King Tiridates III of Armenia. Saint Gregory subsequently became the king&amp;#x27;s religious mentor, and they led the proselytizing activity in the country. In the year 301, Armenia was the first country in the world to be declared a Christian nation. A chapel was initially built in 642 AD at the site of Kirat Virap by Nerses III the Builder as a mark of veneration to Saint Gregory. Over the centuries, it was repeatedly rebuilt. In 1662, the larger chapel known as the &amp;quot;St. Astvatsatsin&amp;quot; (Holy Mother of God) was built around the ruins of the old chapel, the monastery, the refectory and the cells of the monks. Now, regular Church services are held in this church. It is probably the most visited pilgrimage site in Armenia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2015</description>

Si bien es cierto que llegar a las playas más alejadas requiere buenos paseos, recorrer la carretera que cruza la isla, de Maó a Ciutadella, es harto sencillo. Todas las veces que he necesitado transporte no he esperado más de 7 u 8 minutos.

            <description>Direction east. From after this intersection all the way to where the highways merge again, there is plenty of space vehicles to pull over. Either get a ride to the main highway here (thumb and ask for &amp;#x27;otoban&amp;#x27;) or make a sign and walk towards the highway while showing it to passing vehicles.

But fortunatelly we got a ride to Gjirokaster &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 60 min, ride: 23 km ↑&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Untroubled_travelgirls, October 2023</description>

            <description>There is a petrol station and a good point for hitchhiking east to Yozgart, if you stuck into Ankara, take a bus for appr. 3 euro to Kirikalle and ask the bus driver to drop you here infront of the city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Not such a good place though if you want to get onto IC8 direction Pombal. You have to stay exactly where the cars from Pedrogão turn onto EN2, since after that there&amp;#x27;s no  safe space for the cars to stop because of the turnings. Here the margin is almost none-existent too, but at least the cars can see you well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), May 2015&lt;hr&gt;Direction EN2 north. Enough traffic to get a ride easily, not too much to make it dangerous to walk along the (sometimes a bit narrow, sometimes wider) road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), May 2015</description>

            <description>this is the road to the Greek border, so it has very low traffic as only people are using it who want to enter Greece. we were very lucky because got picked up by the 10th car, but for this we waited 30min. there are no trees, and the space is in a valley, so it was very-very hot and the sun was crazy strong. have water with you, and cover yourself (or use umbrella), because the sun can harm you badly, and there is no place to hide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2016</description>

Traffic coming from the roundabout is slow moving and there is a wide bus lay-by for a driver to pull over safely.

            <description>Toll gate. Destination: Taiyuan, Pingyao, Xi&amp;#x27;an.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Datong railway station:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Take the double-decker bus no 15. Get off at the final stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;ll end up in a not particularly pleasant slum area. However, delicious street food is abundant here and the locals are exceptionally friendly and curious. Don&amp;#x27;t be worried to stroll around!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upon getting off the bus, proceed towards the street market. You should see the big factory in front of you, far in the distant background.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take a bit narrow, yet clearly visible street to the left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow that narrow non-paved street till you arrive at a bit lager, tarmacked thoroughfare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Use this image for reference:&lt;br&gt;http://www.image-share.com/upload/1936/82.jpg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turn right and keep on going along the street before you arrive at the express way junction. Turn right, walk for a few minutes before you eventually arrive at the toll gates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hitching to Taiyuan was a breeze. Around 15 mins waiting before I was given a lift by an incredibly friendly driver. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tip: look for the stretches of the Great Wall on your way to Taiyuan, they are clearly visible to the left side, far in the hills!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2012</description>

            <description>Headed north. Not the best spot in the world, but far from the worst. Drivers slow down for the bend and have good enough time to see you and there&amp;#x27;s enough room to safely pull over on either side of the road. Majority of people going north take this route out of town. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Waited 4 hours, for a total of 10 hours over 2 days trying to get out of this town. By some miracle the coolest Dutch woman ever came by and stopped for us and drove us all the way to Perpignan, saving us from this hitchhiking hell they call Spain. We got very very lucky. Save your sanity and take a bus or rideshare with BlaBlaCar or fly out of the country. Hitchhiking Spain is a nightmare. If you want to make more than 50km a day and not wait 3+ hours every time, you gotta hit it lucky with a non-spaniard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5, ride: 480 km ↗&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2024</description>

            <description>There is not a big space for cars to stop, but since there is a traffic light the cars aren&amp;#x27;t that fast yet, so it works well.

            <description>the first car that drove past pricked me up, both up and down. Met a couple who had also hitchiked up. Seems like on this little mountain road people become more hitchiker friendly. One car was greek, the other Austrians. There where very few cars so You can hitchiker in the middle of the road. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 5 min 👍, ride: 10 km →&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―fromage, March 2024</description>

In October 2014 construction of the road was still happening and it made hitchhiking a bit harder.

            <description>Btter spot is maybe a couple of hundred meters further on, on the highway. The spot on the highway is good for rides south towards Izmir. Stand on the shoulder after the traffic lights. To get here it&amp;#x27;s a 45 minute walk from the city center. Try to hitch while walking - I got a lift to the highway, which saved me some sweat...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tomtom (Hitchwiki), July 2014</description>

            <description>Ok hitchhiking spot just along the main road towards the highway (basically anywhere along this road). Find a place with enough space fo cars to pull over.

            <description>Possible to hitchhike to all directions, just find the road signs of your destination.&lt;br&gt;My experience on this spot was always good. But it may be tricky. heavy traffic with many local cars, but locals cars can take you further, use that chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2010</description>

Not a good spot if you are not traveling alone, because here there are just trucks!! If you don&amp;#x27;t find a lift you can always take the bus that stop there nearby, and with 3,60 euro you will arrive in Madrid!!

            <description>Locals and tourists use this way to get to the coastal cities, in particular to Paralia. There is a speed limit and the road itself has a lot of small car parking lots for drivers to stop at. It is much better stop than any in the Katerini city and don’t even think of catching a ride from a train station because there are so many directions you can get from there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 1 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Imchoo, April 2023</description>

            <description>We stood there with a Lisbon sign starting around 14:15 and also asked people. It’s a fairly small gasstation and it was a Sunday so even less cars were coming through but on busy days I would say it’s worth a shot. We gave up after maybe two hours and are now taking a Blabla car to badajoz. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5, wait: 120 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Betlehammer, March 2024&lt;hr&gt;Used a Talavera sign and immediately got picked up by a woman going to Talavera.

We only managed to get a ride to the next gas station close to Móstoles, a short ride that later turned out to be very important. Also managed to get to Lisbon in one day! Speaking to the drivers definitely helps!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), May 2016&lt;hr&gt;i used this spot 4 times, always managed to get to my beautiful Lisbon in the same day. it can take a loooong time to find a ride, but it will work. start early:) you can easily hitch to a next repsol gas station only 2 km further, which is not much better though. for supplies: at the exit of the alto de extremadura metro station there&amp;#x27;s a fruit/veggies shop that throws away loads of nice food around 9pm. close by there a bakery that can give you nice old bread,croissants...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ratodoporao (Hitchwiki), July 2013&lt;hr&gt;After 2 hours of waiting with the sign and asking we gave up and came back to Madrid to take a bus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Dzulajka (Hitchwiki), December 2012&lt;hr&gt;I started at this gas station to go to Lisbon in Portugal.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s easy to get here with Metro 6, station Alto de Extremadura.&lt;br&gt;There are a lot of people, but mainly they stay in Madrid. &lt;br&gt;Try to get a ride on the A-5 to Km 48, there is a gas station with a restaurant and the probabilities to get somebody going to Portugal are better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2011</description>

            <description>Vlore-Sarande: This was one hell of a journey hitchhiking. It&amp;#x27;s a good road to hitchhike down to Himare. But after that, the traffic dies out to eventually nothing. Had the pleasure of hitching a number of short rides to beautiful places, but eventually left me to walk almost 10 KM until almost sundown. I luckily found a ride about 15 KM&amp;#x27;s north of Sarande into the city, otherwise I would have been stranded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2016</description>

I got really lucky, the first car I asked went directly to Lleida (Catalunya) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Laura13 (Hitchwiki), June 2015&lt;hr&gt;Petrol station, Galp. It can be access from the highway Madrid to Zaragoza. It has few traffic, but Its best I found out of the city and that could be reach by public transport+on foot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get here, take a cercanas (metropolitan train) from Atocha, in direction to Alcal de Henares/Guadalajara. Jump off at Alcal de Henares, from then take the bus 9 (frecuency:30minutes) and ask the driver to tell you to jump off before passing over the higway. From there, 10 minutes walking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Otherwise, go on foot from Alcal de Henares train station, is 30 minutes on foot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The petrol station is in a industrial State, so better use it on weekdays, there will be more activity. Ask the drivers to drop you on the next petrol station, even if they dont go a lot further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2011</description>

            <description>Hitchiking is the main means of transportation for most visitors, since bus service is very limited. Tourists with cars and locals know it and usually are glad to give you a ride. This part of the island near the camping sites, and especially this road junction is always busy, you won&amp;#x27;t have to wait long. Anyway, always have water with you when travelling since temperatures can be really hot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2013</description>

Luckily got a ride from the train station to the gas station&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 8 min, ride: 356 km ↗&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2024&lt;hr&gt;We didn´t know how to go out of the city. So we took a bus to Meco and went to gas station. And the place was almost empty! But we had lucky. Some girl took us after maybe 40mins. And it was in summer probably 3 pm.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Boruvka.d (Hitchwiki), August 2016&lt;hr&gt;I just got off the car that took me from Madrid and there was the other car that accepted taking me, not even one minute to take a ride to Zaragoza (gas station)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―A.n.d.1818 (Hitchwiki), November 2013&lt;hr&gt;The only petrol station between Madrid and Guadalajara.

            <description>HH to harrisburg.&lt;br&gt;The place was not too good since it was already on a speedway (two lanes). Eventually after 40 mins and right before a big shower rain a police car picked me up. The officer was nice and took me a good piece of the way to Harrisburg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(In case police car comes dont run away to not provoke suspicion and just ask for a right playing as if it was the most normal thing to do. Worked here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Seems like it should be a good spot to hitch west since there is a roundabout and places to pull over with the main direction out being Aveiro and Visue, but sadly in 2 hours a single car didn&amp;#x27;t stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5, wait: 90 min 🪧&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2024</description>

            <description>I HH here to Harrisburg (about 1-1.5 hours ride).&lt;br&gt;It is possible for the cars to stop on the on ramp to pick you up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to get here?&lt;br&gt;It is a bit tricky I was partly HH and walking from the Allentwon Greyhound bus terminal. Takes some time but the spot is good. Trafic is not too much but cares are not very fast since there is a redlight nearby to slow them down&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

That a bad place to hitchhike. People don&amp;#x27;t stop. &lt;br&gt;Our solution was to walk on the highway for 3km until the next petrol station.&lt;br&gt;Take the direction of the A23, and follow the highway.

            <description>Just after the border you have plenty of space to hitchhike, and border officers dont care. But not many cars, and the main difficulty is to make a greek car stop for a hitchhiker. I tried without cardboard and after that with a cardboard for Thessaloniki (Selaniku in Albanian, and Θεσσαλονίκη in greek (good luck to write it, plan enough space). Finally after 3hours an Albanian took me. (an other car stopped before and was going in Athens but that was not my goal) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 180 min, ride: 197 km →&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―NotASerialKiller, July 2023</description>

            <description>One of the guy who work at the gazstation is very very nice. His name is Hugo, I hope you will meet him. We spent 3 hours together, in middle of the night, talking about stories, waiting for my drive. Awesome time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2012&lt;hr&gt;I dont really know how to place points in here, so I will paste the description of the hitching place here &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The place is a petrol station on a motorway. To get here go south from the city centre, i.e. when standing by Palacio de Gelo shopping centre take the street on your right, sloping downwards. You will pass the Jumbo petrol station, then Mercedes car salon, go further on. After half and hour of walking you will get to the big roundabout under the motorway bridge. Now the hard part, you need to walk alongside the motorway, but luckily for 5 mins only.  &lt;br&gt;I was hitching here twice, and for the first time I got the lift to Aveiro after waiting some 1,5h, then went on asking the people, found a man willing to take me up. The second time I was going to Coimbra, and waited for half an hour when the guy gave me a lift. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2011</description>

&lt;br&gt;I tried to hitchhike from here, there&amp;#x27;s an area where cars can stop, but not many people stop. After 3 hours, a car finally stopped on the motorway to let me in;
&lt;br&gt;I strongly recommend taking a train out of Thessaloniki.

            <description>We took the ferry from Istanbul (Yenikapi) to Yalova to HH our way south. There is a big bus stop at this spot, so perfect for cars to pull over. Lots of traffic, but we (couple, late 20s) still had to wait an hour for the first car to stop. They took us all the way to Kusadasi, which is even further than we planned for the day (originally we planned to get to Izmir).

            <description>best way to go to Turkey, ask the Turkish truck driver.

            <description>On certain parts of 101, such as this one, hitchhiking is illegal and someone will call the police, who will take you to a really dumb area that will be hard to get out of. I guess if you&amp;#x27;re on the on-ramps before the &amp;quot;no pedestrian&amp;quot; signs you&amp;#x27;re fine. Or if no one calls the fuzz on you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2015</description>

            <description>You can stuck here if your car from Tashkent goes to Namangan but you want to go further. There is one important detail about this place - there is a crossroad not far from there and drivers will show you their direction either to the right if he goes to Kokand or left if he goes to Fergana via circular road around Kokand.

            <description>If you arrived here, from Istanbul, it is probably because you followed what it was told on the wiki page (Train to Gebze, 1,5TL). This is not a really good place to hh. It seems like a motorway, but it&amp;#x27;s not. Nothing is lost : I would advice to take a minibus to the O4 Motorway, about 4km away.

I was on my way to the the reggae festival and had a sign that said &amp;quot;REGGAE&amp;quot;, and got picked up before I&amp;#x27;d even found a hitching spot. People around here seem pretty cool.

There might be only one car an hour, but they stop (and in my case nobody asked for money)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tomtom (Hitchwiki), July 2014&lt;hr&gt;If you want to go to Kackar Dagi (like we) you will probably go this way. Its impossible to autostop in this way, because this is onlyone way to Yaylalar (last village before kackar) and noone is going there, only one option is pay for dolmus. Belive me, its only one option. Dont loose time like we was. Ticket costs 25 lira one way :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2012</description>

About 5 - 10 cars a minute, going generally slow, with enough room to pull over while other cars can still get by. Only took about 30-45 minutes each time. Public transportation from NYC: I got dropped off here, but there is also a NJ transit bus stop exactly 1 mile away (W. Main St. &amp;amp; Wall St., Rockaway) which you can bus to from Morristown, and you can get to Morristown from NYC via NY Penn Station. A bit of a stretch, but you can check out the route on google maps, says it only takes about 2 hours. Of course, there may be other good on-ramps to I-80... this is just the one I am familiar with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Gogreatergood (Hitchwiki), March 2013</description>

It&amp;#x27;s a good place but you have to know it&amp;#x27;s not a possible to cross this border by walk. After being dropped by an imam on the border, I walked to the turkish office, let them make their stuff with my papers. Then I had to hitchhike at the border. The simpliest thing to do is to look for a truck. Many trucks there, but you&amp;#x27;ll have to wait for about one hour before crossing the river. At the end, I ended finding a car that was crossing greece to italy in less than 5 minutes at the greek office. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2011</description>

            <description>Entrance to the National Park. There are different fees depending on how high into the mountains you want to go. We just bought the cheapest and went up all the way anyway. Hitchhiking into the NP might take a while but is totally possible. The view is fantastic. Getting back might be an issue as there is extremely little traffic in the evening (2 cars/h). That was after the end of the Macedonian school holidays. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2015</description>

            <description>If you get dropped off North of here along 338, you are probably screwed. The roads are extremely narrow, have almost no traffic, and konbinis are rare. Hitch at your own peril.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2013</description>

            <description>The spot is located beside a petrol station, but on the road. The road is wide at this point and there is a chance for the cars to stop. I hitched here during the winter and the staff of the petrol station gave a glass of hot tea for free in order to keep me warm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2014</description>

            <description>A local hitchhiking friend showed me this spot and it works great. Tried it twice from here, the first time I got picked up to Gebze in about 15 minutes, second time it took me a little longer but in the end I got a ride all the way to Bolu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―HolyDrinker (Hitchwiki), July 2016&lt;hr&gt;Probably the best place to leave Istanbul towards the east. You won&amp;#x27;t catch all the traffic like at the toll gate but you also don&amp;#x27;t risk being sent away by police. Use a sign for Bolu and people will also offer you shorter rides, make sure you get one at least to Gebze as just before that is the first gas station on this road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2016</description>

After 2-3 cars, thats it, you are out of Istanbul! Stopping a car usually takes less then 5 minutes! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2011</description>

            <description>In the center of Rize either you try to get a ride on the local road to get out of the city to the east or, as we did, you can get onto the bridge at the intersection with the ramp and stay inbetween the ramp and the highway to maximize the chances. The drivers have a small place to stop on the side of the highway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2013</description>

            <description>Not the best place to stay, eventually we got a ride of a guy that wanted to help us, but after 2 hours going around Istanbul, left us in a much worse place close to the airport. So be strict with where you want to go. Ask at least for the toll.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Phidias81 (Hitchwiki), August 2014&lt;hr&gt;we just walked like 5 minutes the highway towards north there it is nit that stressy, so we got a lift (boy and girl) after 5 minutes out of Istanbul.

Take the bus to the last stop, get off and walk back to the entrance. From there, you&amp;#x27;ll be hitching directly along the motorway. A sign works well here, and there is plenty of space for drivers to pull over since a lot of buses and minibuses stop for passengers just outside). While exiting, you&amp;#x27;ll notice a petrol station to your right that is a possible alternative starting point where you can ask drivers for lifts (or just use the toilet).

It took only 10 minutes for the first car to stop, which took me the first 20 kilometers. After that it&amp;#x27;s easy as always in Turkey. Just hitch right from the highway - no problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tomtom (Hitchwiki), November 2014&lt;hr&gt;Arrived at 21:00 HHed until 01:00 went to sleep, woke up at 8:00 HHed until around 16:00 when I hot kicked out by the police, while walking away I got offered a ride so I took it. The guy wasnt even going till the next gas station but took us all the way there despite the HIGH gas prices in turkey. Our waiting time could be a result of two males from wich one is arabic and the second one black.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Amines (Hitchwiki), September 2014&lt;hr&gt;Police in Turkey are getting quite strict these days but still seems ok to hitchhike here, there is a small parking area with many cars and trucks a few KM after it so just take the first car that stops to there to avoid any problems with the police.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2013&lt;hr&gt;I wasn&amp;#x27;t lucky here. Took at least three hours till someone finally picked me up. Still I think it&amp;#x27;s a good spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2011&lt;hr&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t think it&amp;#x27;s because of the place in particular, but on motorway or ringroads in Turkey, people stop straight away when they see you and you go very very fast even if you change care every 5 or 10 minutes. It proved right again this time at this spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2011&lt;hr&gt;Very good spot right after a toll station, where cars go slow and have plenty of place for cars to stop. To get here take the metro (M3) to kitelli Sanayi Station and walk from here (maybe 20 minutes)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2011</description>

            <description>I was hitchhiking here in the direction of Bitola, after the road makes a left turn after a bridge and a gas station. This is a bit out of town (at the sign marking the end of Resen), so most cars are going fast and are seemingly reluctant to stop. Might be a better idea to stand a bit closer to town where cars go slowly.

Its pretty quiet but I managed to get a lift within 45 mins.You can catch a bus to Modungo from the port or elsewhere in the city. Get off the bus just after it passes under the autostrada and turns right follow the road ahead and under a road bridge and the motorway. You have to climb up the bank and walk along the autostrada for 300m as the access road to the autogrill is fenced off with a couple of dogs roaming around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2012</description>

            <description>I recommend, but also I was very lucky. The doors were open and I&amp;#x27;ve found a driver in less than 30 minutes. At the beginning I&amp;#x27;ve tried to ask drivers at the station, but finally changed my tactcis. IMHO is better to stay with a cardboard by the road leading to the station (but leave it only a little, so as not to enter the highway!).

Fences are quite okay they fixed the hole where with a hitchhiking sticker on. Agree with all the above there were only local traffic, and some language barrier sometimes.&lt;br&gt;Asked around people a while and eventually gave up and stood with the sign. 1 hour later got an offer from a German lady to Coimbra and from there got a direct ride to Lisbon easily. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not the best nor the worst spot, average, and does worth a try. Once you got out this spot it should be better in my opinion. Low traffic on a Friday afternoon as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2017&lt;hr&gt;Arrived to the spot at 09.09.2015 - oil station and road was closed for repair works! Was a frustration. But right next to, before turning to the oil station there is a narrow road and after half an hour i was picked up with Italian tourists car. Though overall it was quite a bad spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2015&lt;hr&gt;I absolutely agree to what M.chwedczuk says - there&amp;#x27;s almost only local traffic (&amp;quot;vou sair na próxima&amp;quot;). We (hetero couple) would have had a ride after 5 min but only to Aveiro, so we declined. Then 4 hours - nothing. When we wanted to give up we found another car going to Aveiro and went to Lisbon from there.  Maybe it&amp;#x27;s a bit different in the weekend but definitely avoid it during the week!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Nostalgique (Hitchwiki), September 2015&lt;hr&gt;Because of the works at the motorway traffic is weary small. Only locals go there. After 4:30 h of asking all drivers picked a car to next station and their after 5 minutes picked directly to Lisbon. Try to escape Asaph to any other station. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―M.chwedczuk (Hitchwiki), August 2015&lt;hr&gt;My friend (male) and I (female) waited for 50 minutes with a sign &amp;quot;Lisbon por favor :)&amp;quot; and got picked up by a soft toy factory van with old cartoons painted all over it. He took us all the way to Lisbon and even bought us a snack at a rest stop! Great spot with shade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Avocadocity (Hitchwiki), July 2015&lt;hr&gt;We tried this spot for the first time in March 2014. After 2 h of standing with the sign only we had to give up hitchhiking and take a train to Lisbon, since we were in hurry. A few days ago we tried this spot again, this time not wasting our time and speaking with people directly. The very first driver we approached gave us a ride to the next gas station, around 40 km. The roadworks are still around that point, but it´s easy to walk above the fence and move your backpack to the other side too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ewelinalucy (Hitchwiki), January 2015&lt;hr&gt;This good spot I think, but at this time (winter 2014) part of the highway around the gas station is being renovated so some cars don&amp;#x27;t stop maybe because the station is less visible. Fence is not so big, you can easily jump through. Direct drive to Lisboa in 1,5 hours waiting, but refusing some not direct cars earlier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Hitchhiking princess (Hitchwiki), December 2014&lt;hr&gt;perfect place, just take a metro and the walk towards gas station, there is an abandoned building site you have to cross which is not fenced, to go to the station. ask people around in gas station, drivers who stop and they will take you. waited 5-10 min. really perfect place&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2014&lt;hr&gt;Heading to the south with a friend, we thumbed here about 1 hour until a family (driving in a convoy) stopped and took us until a service station near Coimbra. There wasn&amp;#x27;t a big traffic, and most people I asked were heading to some villages/smalltowns nearby. Still, best option to leave Porto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Besnik19 (Hitchwiki), September 2014&lt;hr&gt;I think I got really lucky. I used just my thumb and the 2nd vehicle stopped for me. Took me about 30km from Lisbon and bought me lunch. But ya, he avoided the A1 as much as possible, criss crossing around and taking the side highways. Added an extra hour or so to get to Lisbon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Kidp3 (Hitchwiki), January 2014&lt;hr&gt;October 2013 update:&lt;br&gt;This spot is awesome. The D line now has its final stop at &amp;quot;Santo Ovidio&amp;quot;. You get down there and walk to the back of the gas station on the way described above (20min). It can be tricky to jump the fence to the gas station, but don&amp;#x27;t give up! Put a sign and talk to drivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Dario.drz (Hitchwiki), October 2013&lt;hr&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the best place i know to leave Porto towards south! many drivers are not following to the A1 motorway, so you have to ask many people and waiting time can vary a lot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ratodoporao (Hitchwiki), June 2012&lt;hr&gt;@Despdfr: Wherever you&amp;#x27;ve been, this is highway gas station, it&amp;#x27;s easy to get a ride from here, took as 10 minutes!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Poebbels (Hitchwiki), February 2012&lt;hr&gt;i arrived here in the summer of 2010 with a friend and trying to go to Lisbon. whee stud there 12 hours with no luck. in the morning we go to another gas station on a44 and stud there for another 4 hours and not one car stopped. after i went to the train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Despdfr (Hitchwiki), April 2011&lt;hr&gt;Take Metro (line D; costs: 1,50 €) in direction to D.Joao II. At the final station (D Joao II) go out and wolk on the street a bit untill you come to the round about. There take the street &amp;quot;R.Soares dos Reis&amp;quot;, which you follow untill you alreadz can see the place where a tunel enable you to cross the motorway. Walk to the indicated place (there is a walking path there - which is slightly hidden, so look and).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PLACE good to go to south (LISBON, or AVEIRA). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other side (untested) might be good to go north.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>There&amp;#x27;s limited shoulder on the interstate on-ramps going down most of 95 in Connecticut, but all the on-ramps in Norwalk are screwy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was stopped by a state trooper a ways back for &amp;quot;Improper use of the highway&amp;quot; for being on an on-ramp. (Can&amp;#x27;t actually find anything about this specific term or like terms via Google). Although I didn&amp;#x27;t receive a ticket, I was ordered to move to the street leading up to the on-ramp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can ride on the train to New York City from as far back as New Haven for nine dollars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2015</description>

            <description>I think good idea here is just to have a sign Aveiro, lots of local traffic so you just need to get a bit further&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2017&lt;hr&gt;Hard, but possible, I did it after 3h. Direct drive to Lisbon. Good luck !&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2012&lt;hr&gt;don&amp;#x27;t think it&amp;#x27;s a good place. from here you can walk down just like the cars do until the on-ramp to the highway direction lisbon (forbidden to walk there, but i never had trouble). the ramp seems like a good place, but i rarely had any luck there neither. if you don&amp;#x27;t get a lift you can also walk from the on-ramp (when the on-ramp turns left get out to the street next to it) to the the gas station 1km further down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Ratodoporao (Hitchwiki), June 2012&lt;hr&gt;After the new designing of the spot it seemed somewhat hard to me to get a ride from here, but you can try it and if not lucky go on to the gas station. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Poebbels (Hitchwiki), February 2012&lt;hr&gt;A good spot for hitching south to Aveiro/Lisbon/Algarve. To get here you need to take the metro D line and get off at the Dom Joao II station ( as for September 2010 it was the last stop, but they were making the line longer at the time). Once on the street, go further in the direction you were going in the tram, after 10 mins you will get to the roundabout which leads directly down to the motorway. We ( 1 guy and 1 girl) were waiting here with the sign Aveiro/Viseu, waited for half an hour only. There is enough space for the cars to pull over, and they are going quite slow, most of them were looking me directly in the eyes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2011</description>

            <description>Heading to the south, a local guy told us this was a good spot. Didn&amp;#x27;t wait very long here, but I think it&amp;#x27;s a very bad place for hitchhiking. Hardly any place to pull off safely, drivers go quite fastly and cannot even see you very well... if you wanna head to the south, rather take the metro to Santo Ovdio and try either there or on the highway service station a bit more southwards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2014</description>

            <description>Don&amp;#x27;t let anyone convince you this is a good spot.  Cars will have to cross a lane of traffic to pull over, and then cross a land of traffic again to head southbound.  This makes drivers feel uneasy and is inconvenient.  While it is POSSIBLE to get a lift from any location, statistical probability is not on your side here.  Don&amp;#x27;t do it.    Go to the petrol station past Gaia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Demogirl06 (Hitchwiki), June 2013&lt;hr&gt;Lots of traffic, safe place to pull over...but I waited over 2 hours for a ride...try holding  a sign for Braga, then go on from there maybe...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Hitched a truck down to the turn-off for Tash Rabat (15km walk from here but if you&amp;#x27;re lucky you can get a lift with other visitors). Most of the traffic after At Bashy is trucks heading to the Torugart pass. I asked a car transporter that had stopped just before leaving the town, if you end up sticking your thumb out I&amp;#x27;d recommend turning right at the end of this road and try at the petrol station, vehicles are often going too fast to stop after this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 1 min, ride: 64 km ↙&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2023</description>

            <description>This is a good spot for patient hitchhikers who get rides city by city and not to their destination. I came here on the way from Chaves to Coimbra by bus 51, paid 1,55€. Buses 5 and 31 are also coming and do stop closer. Good traffic, most of them are workers going to other small towns, one offered me a 15km ride but had me refusing when he warned me very low traffic is leaving that village, so I should wait here for a longer ride.
&lt;br&gt;After a hour I opted for a Rede Expresso bus to Coimbra for 10€ through the app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 60 min, ride: 90 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―GiovanniTonucci, November 2023</description>

            <description>The Albanians described in the comment above were probably not waiting for the bus but also hitchhiking (albeit for a fee), so they didn&amp;#x27;t give you bad PR, they just got there earlier than you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of that: easy spot for Elbasan, got a ride within 15 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―HolyDrinker (Hitchwiki), July 2016&lt;hr&gt;The spot is very good towards Elbasan. The traffic is quite slow and a lot of cars pass. But when we were standing here there were 5 Albanians with us, waiting for the bus, but i guess they didn&amp;#x27;t know when it will arrive so they looked like hitchhikers and they were making us bad PR. But after around 25 min we got a ride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Paczix (Hitchwiki), September 2015&lt;hr&gt;towards elbasan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2012</description>

For me it worked out after 1h when I got a sign by the help of the friendly gas station workers and placed myself a little before of the gas station where the cars pass which go on the motorway directly. Cars can not really stop there very well, but many more people will see where you want to go and may want to help out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2015&lt;hr&gt;I was heading to France and most people are just locals.

Might be better in summer. There are NO othere legal places to hitch except this one or as stated above - take train to that village and hitch from there.

            <description>This has not been the easiest spot in my past experience, but the South Weed exit is popular with both truckers and long distance drivers, so you will get a ride eventually, and probably this ride will be long distance. Camping is possible in the National Forest land across the railroad tracks, and the Black Butte Center for Railroad Culture is a 30 minute walk from this onramp. Note that none of the food-marts at this exit take food stamps, so if you&amp;#x27;re food stamp dependent, you&amp;#x27;ll have to walk to the Ray&amp;#x27;s near downtown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2011</description>

This is the end of Avenue  Meridiana, where it turns into the freeway, so there are a lot of cars going long distances.

            <description>Bad experience at noon on a Wednesday. We were traveling to Pamplona and it took us (2 males) more than an hour to get a ride even to the next village.

It&amp;#x27;s pretty hard to approach it, you have to climb up on a steep hillside, but there&amp;#x27;s a lot of space for cars to pull off and they can even see you quite good.

Best possible way to leave Barcelona going south. When you leave the train station, you&amp;#x27;ll have to cross the train tracks (not the ones you came from, the other of the fast train) you can do so by going under, I found water and I crossed the road by the highway bridge.

            <description>Seemed a good place to hitch - straight part of the road, enough place for the cars to stop. However, after 1,5 h of waiting on a very hot day we didn&amp;#x27;t manage to stop anything and decided to walk down to road to a nearby gas station - 1km, hoping it would be easier there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2016</description>

            <description>Very good spot to continue the hitchhike to south. A water spring is available. Drivers smiled, 2 cars stopped within 40-50 minutes and the second one dropped me in Vila Real.
&lt;br&gt;However, if you are going to Viseu/Coimbra, don&amp;#x27;t drop off on the western side of Vila Real where the bus station is, or you&amp;#x27;ll need a city bus to A24 entrance (5/31/51, cost 1,55€). Also if you wanna continue to Porto or the west, that highway entrance in Vila Real city centre looks steep and uncomfortable to wait at, so you&amp;#x27;d better check the map for a better continuation.

&lt;br&gt;Here might be good northward as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 45 min, ride: 28 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―GiovanniTonucci, November 2023</description>

            <description>if you happen to hitchhike via Posof/Vale border point towards Georgia, most dolmush/private cars will either end up in Posof as final destination, or will go to Georgia. However, if you end up with the one going to Posof, get out of the vehicle on the crossroad just bellow Posof town, and 20-30 meters up the road to the border is your best spot to wait for the car going to the border point (that\\&amp;#x27;s this marker). Walking anywhere further gets you uphill and there\\&amp;#x27;s no point of doing that as there are no other roads joining this one up to the border post. &lt;br&gt;Not too many vehicles at all, but that\\&amp;#x27;s what happens with this border crossing, not the hitching point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2011</description>

            <description>This is a gas station on the way to Porto and Barcelos. You can get there easily if you walk through the hidden stairs on the back of the train station. Once you get down you will see a bridge to cross the highway. The first time I went there I got a ride the first time I asked a driver! :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>Arrived here with one friend at 8pm trying to get a ride to Zaragoza. There are a lot of truck drivers but almost all of them stay here for a while to sleep and visit the local strip club. This gas station shuts at 10pm so barely any traffic after that hour. Eventually had to spend a night sleeping in an abandoned house behind the station because the hostel was booked out. Luckily, next morning got a ride from a truck driver almost directly into Zaragoza. There are also people going to Barcelona and Madrid from here. You need to be friendly, pro-active and ask around. Otherwise you can be stuck here for a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, ride: 131 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Kozilia, July 2023&lt;hr&gt;a big gas station, the only one around on this highway. i was lucky and found a ride directly to madrid in 5 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2013</description>

            <description>This is the location of the largest truck stop in the world!  People that don&amp;#x27;t hitchhike think that getting rides from truckers is super easy because they go so far, but the truth is that many of them have insurance reasons that they can&amp;#x27;t pick people up.  I got fooled 3 times at this location from truckers that were pulling over on the shoulder of the on-ramp, but they were not pulling over for me.  After about 2 hours in the hot sun, I got a woman to give me a ride for about a half an hour down the road.  Lots of traffic here, but most of it is semi trucks that won&amp;#x27;t pull over.  Still a decent hitching spot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2016</description>

            <description>Good place to catch a long distance ride with cars heading all the way to Madrid or Pamplona. There is quite a bit of truck traffic too. This area also has a very decent and cheap buffet (€8/person as of July 2023), so a lot of people driving from Barcelona stop here. This is a local spot and there aren’t many foreigners, so knowing Spanish or Catalan is important. The best strategy is to talk to people at the gas station but standing with a sign on a ramp leading to the highway works too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 40 min, ride: 100 km ←&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Kozilia, July 2023</description>

            <description>In 2006 i hitchhike from here towards Burgos. I stood with a cardboard saying Burgos, while i went in the petrol station to talk to the people tanking. It took me about 1 hour to get a good ride. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some friendly workers would take me too, but the didnt go far. If would try this spot again, i would ask them to take me o the petrol station near Cigales, already in the highway to Burgos. This other petrol station is better, and often people traveling far stop there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find that petrol station spotted in this wikimap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2013</description>

I waited for four hours and got a ride to a service  area ten kilometres further from where it was better to hitchhike (you can approach drivers personally there) - maybe there&amp;#x27;s a chance to get directly to this service station - surely the better option. I there&amp;#x27;s no other choice, be creative - make a nice nice sign. dance on the street - I don&amp;#x27;t know. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Mrm1985 (Hitchwiki), June 2015&lt;hr&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t try!

            <description>In the Rhodopi mountains, hitching is likely to get you anywhere quicker than public transport.

            <description>On weekends Sao Bento is usually quite crowded because it&amp;#x27;s an important place for pilgrims. For hitchhiking it&amp;#x27;s okay, we waited maybe 20-30 min (didn&amp;#x27;t get picked up by someone who went to the mass!) - probably better in direction Rio Caldo then Campo de Geres&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2015</description>

            <description>This is the spot you can use to get out of Turkey to Bulgaria. My experience in October 2021 was rewarding. I came to the border gate and the officials said &amp;quot;you can&amp;#x27;t walk&amp;quot; (it&amp;#x27;s been like that for years) and when I stood up few hundreds metres before, soldiers from Jandarma told me to get backwards and try asking at/inside restaurants. This doesn&amp;#x27;t work if you, like me, look Middle Eastern so the truck drivers will ignore you thinking you&amp;#x27;re irregular. So I took a dolmuş back to the pinned gas station and waited 2 hours (could be much less) until a Turkish man took me with him to casino in Svilengrad, offered me the entrance and a private hotel bedroom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 120 min, ride: 30 km ↖&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―GiovanniTonucci, November 2023&lt;hr&gt;For some reason (to get the traffic from all the rest places) I walked 10 km from the boarder to this place. A truck picked me up after a couple of hours and brought me to Istanbul. Most of the traffic is going to Edirne though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2013</description>

            <description>The spot itself is very good, as there&amp;#x27;s a lot of room for cars to pull over, on both directions.&lt;br&gt;The problem is Italian people being not confident at all with hitchhiking.

            <description>It is probably best to walk to this spot when coming from the airport, because 80% of the traffic are taxis. From this junction on you can start hitchhiking to the west (to Tbilisi) or east to Armenia or Azerbeidzjan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2013</description>

            <description>I have mixed feelings about this spot.  I was hitching late in the day for about 2 hours with no luck.  The next morning I was hitching for about a half hour when a girl pulled over headed all the way to Rapid City, SD!  This was the best ride I have ever gotten, but I got it in a really crappy place for hitchhiking.  Very few cars to begin with, and if she had been an Iowa resident she probably wouldn&amp;#x27;t have pulled over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2016</description>

            <description>I&amp;#x27;ve hitched from here at least a dozen times to get to Salt Lake City or Brigham City.  Never had to wait longer than 30 minutes.  To get here from the center of Logan you can either WALK or take the bus.  The nearby McDonald&amp;#x27;s is the last stop for one of their lines ... I usually stand close to the golf course to stay away from the businesses in the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>There is written that there are buses #84 and #64, but you can take any bus to Digomi district or Zahesi district or you can use metro to Didube station and from bus station take bus to agricultural university. I start hitch-hiking after Gldani turn (there is long bridge, so you will see it). after there is several turns but in most of cases drivers are keeping the main road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Koshma (Hitchwiki), June 2011&lt;hr&gt;if you want to Hitchhike from Tbilisi to west, to the black sea coast, first you should get out from Tbilisi by bus. You can take #84 bus from Tsereteli Avenue or #64 from Chavchavadze Avenue which goes out from Tbilisi and drops you on the main highway from which majority of cars go to the west of Georgia. You should get off bus on David Agmashenebeli Kheivani (Valley), the best one is to get off at Lukoil Gas Station and take a walk about 150 metres and start to hitchhike. You can say Hello in Georgian &amp;#x27;Gamarjoba&amp;#x27; to the driver and ask for the ride. &amp;#x27;I have no money&amp;#x27; in Georgian is &amp;#x27;Puli ar mak&amp;#x27; so you can use this phrase as well in hitching in Georgia. Drivers are super-friendly so you won&amp;#x27;t have any probs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Terrible spot if  you  are  trying  to  catch the 84  to  Portland/ Seattle. I  tried  every 84  west  on ramp  in this god  forsaken  city  to  no  avail. 75% of all  cars  in  this  town  are  taking  the 15,  not  the 84.  Of the vehicles  that are,  they are  primarily  pickup  trucks  packed to the brim  with farming  gear  or  Mormon  families. I  have been stuck  in this city  for 2  days and since  my  dogs feet are bleeding I  will  likely be here  several  more. if  you are  heading  up  the 15 I  suspect  hitching will be better here,  but there is no point trying to catch the 84  here ( from my experience) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2013</description>

            <description>Very good spot to leave Chaves towards south, you should come here by bus to Boticas and ask the driver to drop you at Autopista before Casas Novas (i departed from Boticas at 7:30am and he made an extra stop for me).
&lt;br&gt;You should wait on the short lane where cars have just turned left and had time to see you. Most of drivers smiled. After 40 minutes a man in a modern pick-up took me to Vila Pouca de Aguiar and offered me 15€, this has been the first time within European continent :D
&lt;br&gt;İn Vila Pouca, drop off at city centre highway entrance, easy to continue. Water spring available.
&lt;br&gt;İn Vila Real, don&amp;#x27;t drop off at city centre entrance, or you&amp;#x27;ll need a city bus (5/31/51) from nearby bus station to continue towards Viseu and Coimbra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 45 min, ride: 61 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―GiovanniTonucci, November 2023</description>

            <description>carefull! it is complicated to go there. You should take a bus to svelingrad and then fint the way to the 8 road (people dont speak english there and there are barely no sings) and hitchike OR take a bus for one or tow stations and then walk or hitchhike. I found the border police office where they talked english and one of the guys took me to the border by car. I would advise you to try and get help from locals to go to the border.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2012</description>

            <description>Used this spot when going north towards Veliko There isn&amp;#x27;t much traffic but people will stop for you on this route. The disadvantage being that most are only drivng a few km.

            <description>It&amp;#x27;s easy to hitchhike North or West from anywhere along this stretch of road. Bus 14 (from Rustaeli metro) and marshrutkas 32 and 41 stop here, among many others. You need to be careful to get off the bus here (tell the driver!!) because if you miss the stop the bus turns around and, you&amp;#x27;ll have to cross the busy highway or walk 10 minutes north to an underpass. If you&amp;#x27;re going north towards Gudauri/Kazbegi and a car going West stops for you, it will be really helpful to ride about with them to the turnoff where the road splits towards Gudauri/Russian border. Many cars will drive away when you tell them you&amp;#x27;re going to Gudauri because they think they can&amp;#x27;t help you, so if you&amp;#x27;re not good at Russian, try to sign language that you want to go to the turnoff to Gudauri and have them take you there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2016</description>

            <description>This struck me as the most obvious spot to catch a lift away from the airport after walking out of the arrivals terminal. I did catch a lift after some 20 minutes, but those were spent anxiously expecting the cops to pull up and dump some shit on me. Just before the highway sign and just after a bend. There must be a better spot somewhere around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2013</description>

            <description>Toll gate - excellent spot for rides west towards Beijing (waiting time 30 minutes). Staff and highway police didn&amp;#x27;t care. To get here take the metro (Line 1) to Yingbin Lu station. From here it&amp;#x27;s a 30 minutes walk to the toll gates. 800 meter along Shenda Rd. turn right onto Dongpinghu St. 400 meter later turn left on Honghui Rd. which passes under the highway a couple of hundred meters later. Here turn left (there&amp;#x27;s a small opening in the fence) and cross over the deserted rest area towards the toll gates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2014</description>

            <description>if you want to catch the ride for Kazbegi (Stepantsminda) which is in the Northern Georgia, the Mtskheta Highway is the best way to Hitchhike. Hold the Kazbegi sign with a little smile and you&amp;#x27;ll get the ride, though it may take some time. be patient and you&amp;#x27;ll get the ride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>It’s probably a great place if you&amp;#x27;re being left there by a car, at the gas station.
&lt;br&gt;If you’re trying to get to it from outside, it is  NOT a safe place. Drivers are pretty much crazy here and the visibility is limited. The places mentioned before were repaired, probably, cause we decided that it’s too dangerous to try climbing that little wall on the left. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Pantaera, August 2023&lt;hr&gt;It is still possible to climb the fence. Close to the entrance to the gas station there is a small building where the fence is a bit broken (maybe because of the hitchhikers who climbed it...) The small building helps you to climb. After that the second driver that i asked gave me a lift to Napoli.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 2 min, ride: 195 km ↘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―HUNmeszabi, February 2023&lt;hr&gt;We (boy and girl) spend extremely long period of time here. At the same time the first and last car which stopped took us almost to Sicilia.

Now to enter there is an hole in the fence, you have to pull it up from the ground&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Phidias81 (Hitchwiki), May 2012&lt;hr&gt;I put my opinion here too. I had some good adrenaline to run towards the fence, but it would&amp;#x27;ve been very hard if we couldn&amp;#x27;t get to that spot. The gas station is a main key to get out of Roma to go south.

The gas station is not huge, but it was quite crowded (it was holiday)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2011&lt;hr&gt;To go South: this is the first gas station on the highway connecting Rome to the A1 highway going south. It&amp;#x27;s still inside the city, so very easy to reach, but it&amp;#x27;s already on the highway. There is a fence on the back but if you look trough some bushes where a little building is, the fence is broken and easy to climb. Go to Anagnina station either by metro or by bus (it&amp;#x27;s one of the biggest terminal in Rome)  take the bus 046and stop at &amp;quot;carnevale lettere&amp;quot;, the gas station is only 400 m away. Walk back for a few meters  cross the road and turn right on via cavaglieri, and then the first left, and at the end of the street there is the gas station. there are also other buses going around the area (500, 504...) just use the route planner of public transport to see what&amp;#x27;s the best for you&lt;br&gt;http://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?lingua=ENG&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2011</description>

Hitching toward ulcinj during summer is advisable to start very early, 6-7am any later and traffic is awful and rides and unlikely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the even a minibus runs very often to ulcinj for 1 euro.

            <description>It was incredibly hard to leave this place without paying five euros. All the Albanian cars who stopped asked for a fee, it took us more than two hours to find an international car which went to Albania and took us for free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Palihitcher (Hitchwiki), September 2014&lt;hr&gt;we took a &amp;quot;taxi&amp;quot; here after 45 mins, (which was also 5e), as we didn&amp;#x27;t expect to find an easy ride here: in summer, people know how to get money out of travellers ;) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Mrw.witteveen (Hitchwiki), July 2014&lt;hr&gt;We had a free ride from here to Shkoder.

&lt;br&gt;Best place to go to GREECE
&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s a lane for cars to stop on this giant road; you can see the cars coming from far, far away. After 20 minutes I found a woodcutter who took me to a toll booth near the border.

Thessaloniki. Good amount of cars, good visibility, lots of space for the people to stop and even a small market where drivers stop to shop for small things so you can go and talk straight to the drivers.&lt;br&gt;Take bus 65B from the Skopje central rail station and hop out somewhere close to this part of the city, after the gas station that you&amp;#x27;ll see on the left (it&amp;#x27;s marked as a HH spot 1km before this one).&lt;br&gt;Good luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2016</description>

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You need to climb a couple fences to get here. When you arrive at Settebagni(possible to blackride bus from Rome), go north-east to the tip of the town, and cross through some allotments, to get to the little road leading to a bridge over the highway. On the other sode of the bridge there is a gate, but the fence is ripped open on the right. Go through there and turn right on to the field, and cross it, over to the fence alongside the road. Climb that and follow the highway for a hundred meters, and you’re there!
&lt;br&gt;We wanted to go to Firenze, but i guy picked us up towards Terni, where we thought we could get a ride to Firenze, but found the truckstop there to be awful. If you’re going to Firenze or further north, wait for a car going there instead of a car going half the way!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5, wait: 25 min, ride: 64 km ↑&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2023&lt;hr&gt;Did in it again in November. Took my  girlfriend and me 3 minutes to find a direct ride to Switzerland!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2016&lt;hr&gt;Did this again in August 2016 and it was all good!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Emanuele19956 (Hitchwiki), August 2016&lt;hr&gt;I had to go through the bushes, and jump over the fence. I had a tick on my leg after that so be careful! Than I had to wait 30 minutes to catch a transport so it&amp;#x27;s profitable!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Artur Pietrus (Hitchwiki), June 2016&lt;hr&gt;I did this in December 2015, and it&amp;#x27;s perfectly doable AS LONG AS you&amp;#x27;re very determined. Refer to this link to see the path I used: http://1drv.ms/1PxI6eu When Via Capoliveri ends, go straight into the bushes. You should be able to see a very narrow trail, that splits up almost immediately. If you go right, it&amp;#x27;s a dead end, so go left and just follow the trail. The bushes are dangerously thorny, so make sure your clothing is appropriate. When you reach the highway, turn left and walk down the road (behind the guardrail). The path will get steeper and narrower (you might fall and roll down the hill into the highway if it&amp;#x27;s slippery), so go back into the trees (circled in blue). The trees are pretty thick, but still, you can work your way until you reach a metal fence that&amp;#x27;s been obviously climbed over a thousand times before. Go for it and you&amp;#x27;re on the bridge. Cross the bridge and then it&amp;#x27;s really easy to reach the gas station. Nothing dangerous to report about that part. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It took me 15 mins to find a direct ride to Milan!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Emanuele19956 (Hitchwiki), January 2016&lt;hr&gt;A really good starting place for your trip out of Rome. I&amp;#x27;ve used this one in July 2014 and had no problem getting there - a few comments above some1 posted some very useful directions as to how to walk there from Settebagni. We didn&amp;#x27;t wait 15mins and caught a car straight to Firenze.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Tschesky (Hitchwiki), February 2015&lt;hr&gt;hello therewe went trough the bushes and it was ok. but remember, if you need to go out of Rome you need to cross to another side of the A1 road just use the tunnel under it (the tunnel is just behind the petrol station) we were 2 girls and we stopped the car in 20 min and we were lucky enough cause we took just one car directly to perugia. Good luck! and thanks for the map&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Yallar (Hitchwiki), August 2014&lt;hr&gt;Ok guys, I did it and i&amp;#x27;m happy that survived ;)&lt;br&gt;Take a notice that from train station to the gas station road is at least exhausting. On the map it look clear and easy, in reality you have to CLIMB up and up, like a 1 km. The hill is high and you need a good condition to do that, especially during the summer.&lt;br&gt;Attention!: when street &amp;quot;via capoliveri&amp;quot; finish please dont go straight though a wild garden.&lt;br&gt;I made that mistake and my legs were all stratched and i was bleeding. Just madness. &lt;br&gt;There is a road beetween two gas stations, so your host can pick you up there and return.&lt;br&gt;Good luck everyone!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2014&lt;hr&gt;So, the adventure is waiting for you. The simplest road is closed (may, 2014) and it seems that it will be closed for like a year. Use this map first http://goo.gl/maps/4ff03 and then go to the bushes straight and on the left, parallel to the road. There is a path made by other people. You will have to jump over the fence to reach the overpass of Via dell&amp;#x27;Inviolatella Salaria. Then short walk through the fields and you will reach the gas station :) &lt;br&gt;There is almost no sense to stay with the cardboard sign in Italy, it&amp;#x27;s better to ask people. Prepare some useful phrases and the map. &lt;br&gt;Good luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Prosektor (Hitchwiki), May 2014&lt;hr&gt;I did extremely long and exhausting investigation in this area before I found more-less easy way to get the spot (without &amp;#x27;dirty water and canal&amp;#x27;) - through the bridge on the Via dell&amp;#x27;Inviolatella Salaria.&lt;br&gt;Here is my way (green one). Don&amp;#x27;t try red one!&lt;br&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B25BpcbbENGJcTdjVjdLRkp3S3M/edit?usp=sharing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Lev-amatuni (Hitchwiki), February 2014&lt;hr&gt;This gas station is not availaible at the moment (07august2013),  be careful! The only road that you can use to go from Settebagni to autostrada is on a repair now. It&amp;#x27;s better to choose another &amp;quot;benzinaio&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Bonifer (Hitchwiki), August 2013&lt;hr&gt;Arriving this place you have to pass from one workshop, garden, dirty water canal and lots of scratches, but it&amp;#x27;s a good place to hitchhike towards Firenze and don&amp;#x27;t try to go directly to Siena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Astala27 (Hitchwiki), July 2012&lt;hr&gt;You actually don&amp;#x27;t need to pay the 0.90€ of the train ticket, if you alredy stamped a bus ticket, it&amp;#x27;s still good also for the train till Settebagni, if you are within the time limit&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Phidias81 (Hitchwiki), May 2012&lt;hr&gt;Good place to reach from Rome, but pay attention after ):30 on weekends there are almost no train. In this case take the bus in front of Tiburtina train station&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Phidias81 (Hitchwiki), April 2011&lt;hr&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a petrol station with restaurant, decent place to start frpom Rome. You can take the train that goes to Orte and stop at Settebagni. It leaves from many stations in Rome and costs only 0.90.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2011</description>

            <description>Absolutely pointless. It&amp;#x27;s not a bad place, I&amp;#x27;ve got a couple of rides from it, but, if you walk five minutes to the spot in the C-66, you get a much better one. The only exception is talking to a local who was riding in the same train than you and, if he has his car parked in the station, or has someone to pick him up, convincing him to give you a lift. But trust me, go to the junction with the c-66 and hitch there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2011</description>

            <description>I paid 700som for getting 2 of us to Kirovsk and no regrets were expirienced. There were 4-5 cars in 6 hours and destination is unknown.

            <description>I was going to try hitchhiking here but there were 2 problems.  First, the traffic is ridiculous and it is super hard to cross the street without getting hit.  Second, even if you are on the correct side of the road to hitch west they don&amp;#x27;t cut down any of the grass or plants so you would have to walk through tons of brush right on the side of the highway in order to get to the on-ramp.  I wouldn&amp;#x27;t even try it here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2016</description>

            <description>Direction---&amp;gt;everywhere
&lt;br&gt;Slow cars and vans from the ships/cruises are about to start their journey, most of them smiled or waved at me. Also those driving from &amp;quot;parking north&amp;quot; (opposite the ship i was in) pass by here. As less long-range drivers and tourists pass by there, I don&amp;#x27;t think the yellow northern spot on this hitch-map could be more strategic.
&lt;br&gt;If the lane on the right is closed, you can stand and wait. Just be respectful of traffic and police will tell you nothing. Some tourists asked me for info and wished me good luck.
&lt;br&gt;Nearby buses regularly connect the train station. 9:30am to Vatican and Rome.
&lt;br&gt;A very young guy took me to Rome after 2h when i hid my sign to Rimini, however i could have waited longer for a further ride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 150 min 🪧, ride: 281 km ↑&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―GiovanniTonucci, May 2024</description>

            <description>in case that you already crossed the border and you were droped off by a car immediatley behind it, u just can go straight ahead along the street and just stop the cars by thumb. Traffic is not that heavy (I think it depends on the day time) but  the 3rd or the 4th car at latest will give you lift. I just walked 5-10 minuts, then I got a lift to the city center of Skopje.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2012</description>

            <description>When going to Turkey, don&amp;#x27;t bother using a sign here. There won&amp;#x27;t be any direct traffic because that will take the (practically unhitchable) highway, so just put out your thumb, get a ride to the next (sizable) town (Haskovo in this case) and repeat from there until you get to the border.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―HolyDrinker (Hitchwiki), July 2016&lt;hr&gt;is it a safe route ? i will arrive late at night and i need to reach istanbul, would it be possible to arrive in the morning ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Artpasnet (Hitchwiki), June 2014&lt;hr&gt;not soo many trucks going to turkey but you can find a lift to get out of plovdiv. we were lucky and get a lift to the border&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Dersoeren (Hitchwiki), September 2012&lt;hr&gt;We were very lucky to the border, but after the border traffic was very slow.

            <description>On our way from Barcelona to Saragossa/Madrid we found a lift, who took us close to Huesca. He brought us to a gasoline station (Galp Loporzano) it´s 8km from huesca at the N-240. This place seemed to be in the middle of nowhere for us, but as our driver said, it´s pretty easy to escape from there, cause many people stop there. We cannot proof that but for us it was. we managed to get away within 10 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, February 2017&lt;hr&gt;Towards Pamplona it should be a good spot, people going on A-23 or A-132 should come this way towards Pamplona. Me and a friend of mine (1 girl+1guy) were hitchhiking here for 6 hours, because the police officers wanted to checkout the drivers the same morning we wanted to get out of here, and noone stopped because of this. After the officers disappeared, we hitched a ride within 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2014</description>

Were hitchhiking in a couple (a guy and a girl), with a sign written in Bulgarian [София моля те :) - Sofia, please :) ] and literally stopped a car in 1 minute.

            <description>Depending on the season, this is a great spot to hitchhike to Tbilisi. I did it couple of times. As Ananuri itself is a pretty popular tourist destination (and other people will come from Pasanauri or as far as Gudauri and Kazebgi) there should be plenty of opportunities to catch a ride. It is not the perfect location though and people will drive a bit fast )) Enjoy!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2015</description>

            <description>Waited for about 2 hours with no success.  I had to come back the next day.  In the morning I waited another 2 hours and right before I threw in the towel I got a ride to Benton Harbor, MI.  The ride was fine but I hated having to wait so long.  The girl that picked me up said that the people of Watervliet don&amp;#x27;t tend to think well of strangers and so I was lucky that I got a ride.  If you can help it I would advise not hitching here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2016</description>

            <description>A lot of traffic to Burgas, not to Svilengrad. We got stuck there for 11 hours. If u are going to Turkey just walk around and ask turkish drivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2022&lt;hr&gt;Small gas station but probably your only option if you&amp;#x27;re going towards Turkey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point (November 2015) hitchhiking to Turkey is next to impossible because of the newly opened road. The traffic density is VERY LOW (highway with 1 car every 5 minutes or so) and there are absolutely no gas stations or any hitchhiking spots along the road, and the average speed is way too high to hh directly from the highway. Effectively this means you&amp;#x27;ll have to get a direct ride to the border from here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2015</description>

            <description>The beginning of the ring road (which actually goes through town) is a terrible place to wave.

This place is in the begining of a town (coming from Skopje). Most drivers, except transit vehicles, go into the town, so you can experience high waiting times at this place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2014</description>

            <description>We gave up after waiting for three hours, and were actually picked up while walking up the mountain road.
&lt;br&gt;Locals don&amp;#x27;t stop because they assume you are for the border, and Bulgarians assume it&amp;#x27;s a local thing. Mornings there is huge amount of traffic to a mine (рудник) so put up a sign &amp;quot;5km&amp;quot; or something of the sort. From where the road of the mine goes off the main road it is just a few bends of the road to the top where the border is (and you can find path that cut those bends).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;But generally if you coming from inside Macedonia towards Bulgaria, much better option is to use the spot at the Kumanovo toll station (patarina) and ask directly cars with BG numbers. They seem to be less willing to stop on foreign territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5, wait: 180 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―kadaifbalkan, June 2023&lt;hr&gt;Low traffic, but there are no alternatives.

            <description>Got fast a car to Tbilisi. Drivers were stopping often. As a single female be careful, my driver was very annoying. Initially he had to drop me at the junction before Tbilisi, where I could get another ride to Stepantsminda, but instead drove me to Tbilisi. Luckily my friend managed to help me get rid of this dude. Good luck and the spot is really great to find a car!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2018&lt;hr&gt;This spot is great to find rides inbound Tbilisi and further; plenty of space for both cars and trucks to stop and all the traffic passes by this point.

            <description>Almost immediately got a ride here from an old Albanian man. Although he wanted money, we could quickly haggle down to 5€ a person all the way to Shköder. It was no problem to us since it was the same price as the bus from Ulcinj to Shköder which we were planning to take.&lt;br&gt;He was nice and we also realize people don&amp;#x27;t have as much money in Albania as we do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―NickBe (Hitchwiki), August 2014&lt;hr&gt;Gas station in the center of the city.

            <description>Most probably we just had pure luck, but we (1 girl+1guy) hitched a direct ride to Bilbao from here, holding a sign &amp;quot;Pamplona&amp;quot;. The traffic is very small but there are quite a lot of tourists in this area, therefore it can work. Worst case, the scenery is beautiful! :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2014</description>

The traffic is slow moving as it joins the road to Madrid, there&amp;#x27;s a safe spot to pull over and it&amp;#x27;s also in the shade.

            <description>It felt like a decent spot, even if it’s in the city centre. There’s a little used bus stop and a parking area in front of the sports centre for cars to pull to the side. Lots of traffic, but most of it is local. I got no luck (was trying to get to Santiago with a sign). In the end I decided to move and got a lift much faster from my second spot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2023</description>

            <description>I don’t how you people autostop from here. I’m sure it’s possible but just tell me the way. It’s a big road with a looot of cars that don’t have where to stop nor how to see you. On top of that when you go to Madrid the cars nearest to you are not going there so you won’t pick anyone near you. The only idea I had was to ask people on the red light, but as I said it would be people on the middle of the road and I didn’t want to risk being there when the light turns green. I’m disappointed I tried both ways out of Burgos to Madrid and both are bad, I’ll have to take a bus :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5, wait: 40 min, ride: 288 km ↓&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2023&lt;hr&gt;Why not, but LOTS of trafic.

While we waited here a guy came and gave us food just like that. I want to deeply thank him for that becouse it helped me a lot at that time and I hope he can read this.

            <description>The roundabouts leading to the autovia and the nacionale feel a bit sketchy so I decided to come by this secondary roundabout. Cars pass very slowly and quite a few get on the motorway. There’s space to pull to the side. Someone stopped after 10min for me (was probably lucky) and took me for about 15min on the nacionale to the edge of Ourense but I didn’t have any luck at that second spot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 10 min, ride: 8 km ↑&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2023</description>

            <description>Hmmm... it is visible, but the cars were very fast there. On the gas station, mostly local people going back to town or the neighbourhood. &lt;br&gt;I hadn&amp;#x27;t at all a feeling for this spot... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I walked further on, passed the junction, and while heading to Castañares (which looked much better... slower road), thumb out and I got a ride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Davor (Hitchwiki), August 2016&lt;hr&gt;Is visible and cars have time and space to stop.. you can also talk with people in the gas station.&lt;br&gt;Direction: Logroos&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2014</description>

            <description>I used this spot several times to hitchhike to Racha region. Get somehow to Tkibuli from where you simply walk, wald, walk and waive your hand on the way. Within the city, most people are likely to stay within the city. When you approach the end of the city, chances increase that somebody drives to Racha. Be aware, though, that this road is not really frequented. Once you are outside the city, cars are extremely likely to take you with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2015</description>

            <description>&lt;br&gt;A place to get a ride direction north  (Santander). There&amp;#x27;s a gas station nearby, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two roads going up to Santander, following slightly different routes... both from this spot, and perhaps from the gas station, you&amp;#x27;ll find cars going up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a Sunday morning there was plenty of cars passing this spot, I had a sign to Santander, and in 10min got the first ride that took me some 30km up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can&amp;#x27;t say though if it&amp;#x27;s a good spot at anytime... it looks ok, not great but ok.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a warehouse and fields kind of area... not much there, but easy to reach walking out from Burgos. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I came walking from little roads behind the castle hills, if you come along the main road, maybe there&amp;#x27;s other good spots before that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2016</description>

NEVER!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Davidkuski (Hitchwiki), August 2013&lt;hr&gt;This place is very good, lot of space to stop, it is still in the city and the cars go still slow and there is a big tree where you can hide in its shadow. BUT I was wondering about to give it SENSELESS because almost noone ride this way. But this way is most beautiful way to Kotor.

Lots of Quebecois, although mostly with full cars (I was told they were returning from Florida). Declined a couple of shorter rides until eventually settling for a ride with a Vermonter who took me all the way to Glens Falls.

            <description>I have seen people hitchhiking from here to get on the AP-9 highway. I would not recommend to try it here. Cars are coming from different directions, there are curves and there is not really much space for cars to stop. I would rather try 100 meters before the bridge. Still you will encounter a lot of local traffic. Good luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2015</description>

            <description>A few folks stopped, but they were pretty short rides. I got a few kick downs. Smokes and donuts. The ramp has a curb, but there is a wide shoulder on the highway. Although traffic is moving pretty quickly, and no one seemed to want to stop.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I left the spot because of construction. I agree, it seems like the other ramp in town may be better for both north and south bound traffic. Although if someone offers a ride out to Pleasant Valley (north), you could ask to get dropped off at the Manzanita rest stop, and try hitching from there. It&amp;#x27;s not far, but I wouldn&amp;#x27;t want to walk there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 240 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―AngryOtter, September 2023&lt;hr&gt;Going north, we were told this is much better than the other Grant&amp;#x27;s Pass onramp, but the shoulder on the onramp is pretty narrow and we waited two hours without anybody stopping.

            <description>Good spot for hitchhiking to Bastia. go past the bridge, take left at the fork, pass the first building to reach a parking lot entrance. Wide shoulders next to a small road, right after a bridge, so people drive slowly and have no difficulties to stop. 30 minutes waiting, with thumb in the air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Great place in both directions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Oscypek (Hitchwiki), August 2012&lt;hr&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a great spot but if you have time, don&amp;#x27;t miss the bay area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Sam iam (Hitchwiki), May 2012&lt;hr&gt;this is a marker for a ferry between Lepetane and Kamenari. The ferry charges cars but it\\&amp;#x27;s free for passengers. You can load on the ferry while it\\&amp;#x27;s waiting for the cars to load (usually 15minutes). Ferry ride is very short, few minutes. Ferry works both ways between this places. It is extremely easy once you are on the ferry, to ask any driver who\\&amp;#x27;s in a car to give you a ride either towards the border with Croatia or backwards to Kotor/Budva. Recently, a new road up to Zabljak/Durmitor rises from Risan, and you can ask drivers around and find those too. Very good spot (the ferry board).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, January 2011</description>

I can&amp;#x27;t even remember whether I was holding my &amp;#x27;Berane&amp;#x27; sign when I was picked up, but my driver was the bloke who puts up all of the billboard adverts in the country and he took me to the Serbian border on his shift.

            <description>Not so high volume of traffic but around 10 cars/min, we were heading to Burgos and we got a ride just after 10 mins The place is just after the water canal, which is passing under the road and there was a gypsy house just 50 m behind us. Just be annoying to the drivers don&amp;#x27;t forget you are in Spain, which means being annoying is counted for friendly.

            <description>This was our best spot (better than the edge of Perpignan) to get a lift all the way to Barcelona.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the cars are going that way so it&amp;#x27;s much more likely. As other users recommend, try to get a lift all the way to your destination in Spain, as hitching Spain is hard, even at Auto-stops! We thought we had a lift with a trucker to Barca, but he actually took us 40 miles out of the centre to a sleep-over truck stop, which for a trucker probably is Barcelona!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We had no trouble with the Police hut here (it was empty), but perhaps ask your ride here to take you to the stop off point AFTER the Peage when coming here just in case...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Squeezeboxjoe (Hitchwiki), February 2014&lt;hr&gt;I got there as I could not hitch hike in the Peage as 1.there was a fence at the begining and between the lines and 2. there is a police station a couple of meters after the peage,facing it. To reach this point, I went to this highway service station on the left side of the peage as you see it from here,went while in it all straight sideways so that nobody sees me(forbidden) and then crossed  the street that leads to the small peage,reaching the point. The place is exactly behind the police small van. Some people stop there for a break and some trucks as well.You can magnificently try with a sign,there is much traffic and the cars are driving not so fast.Got a lift to Girona.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2013</description>

            <description>We got dropped off by another car before the toll and walked on the path on the right side towards this parking lot. There were police at the checkpoint and they were using the pullout to do checks. They were friendly enough to give us a ride the the roundabout just before the toll on the other side, so maybe this counts as our shortest hitch of the journey? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Eriiiii, March 2023</description>

Not even a minute passed.&lt;br&gt;Our friends waited there 15 minutes, just after us, so it&amp;#x27;s quite good spot for going to Montenegro.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Burrito (Hitchwiki), August 2013&lt;hr&gt;Got a lift to the Montenegrin border although it was already dark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Degoiabeira (Hitchwiki), April 2012&lt;hr&gt;Traffic is light after Dubrovnik. Got a ride immediately from a Bulgarian couple, who were staying in Kotor, Montenegro. I would say that was down to luck. Although the road is quite good for hitching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, August 2011</description>

            <description>Zvekovica-Herceg Novi: Right after the turn to Cavtat and right before airport is a decent spot to catch a ride. However most of the people headed that direction are going to the airport. Locals apparently hate Montenegro and don&amp;#x27;t go (War grudges). Got lucky to catch a lift to at least to ilipi to avoid the airport traffic. Had to walk 6 KM towards border before a driver picked me up from there. Awful. Croatians need to be more open minded man!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2016</description>

            <description>WE were dropped off from the direction barcelona. so our destination was montpellier. At the gas station there are two sides. the cars who are filling up there gas on the left side are heading to north, the others to south. We waited 1,5 days to get a lift to montpellier. I thought it will be better than before the border. But hey! Why 1,5 days? Weve met a lot of nice people but all the cars were full or the people think we are crazy damn alcohilcs. i dont know....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Sonnenguru (Hitchwiki), September 2015&lt;hr&gt;I was dropped there direction Barcelona, that was a very bad idea, nobody there. I finally walked to the D900 which is just 10mins walk, i then got a lift in 10mins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Dylg (Hitchwiki), November 2014&lt;hr&gt;Seemed to be a good idea but got stuck here for 3+ hours... Maybe it was just the wrong day to try (2nd Sept) but I see a couple of problems with this place if you are going north.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- even though it is a big service area, Spaniards coming from Spain would have already stopped at La Jonquera that vastly reduces your chances&lt;br&gt;- the truck parking lot is a 5 minute walk from the station itself which makes it impossible to cruise around both trucks and cars asking for a ride&lt;br&gt;- the petrol station has two exits, so if you are a cardboard guy, you have to back off beyond the roundabout where the two roads merge. Again, drivers are already prepared mentally to drive away by then so you&amp;#x27;ll need quite some luck to stop them&lt;br&gt;- you may try the very highway entrance close to the truck parking but there is no shadow and cars are already going at a decent speed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long story short, get dropped off at La Jonquera instead!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Lvsti (Hitchwiki), September 2013&lt;hr&gt;This is a useful service area to be dropped to if you&amp;#x27;re hitching north from Catalonia along the motorway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I waited for 1h 10 mins for a ride: a truck that took me to near Nmes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, October 2011</description>

            <description>Walking through the Ghost villages of Navarra. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Seeing how desolate the French Way was, I started thinking about rejoining the North Way through Gasteiz, to Bilbao. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Between Barbarin and Luquin, one gentleman finally gave me a ride to Los Arcos. There I tried hitch hiking again north to Gasteiz, to no avail. I ended up taking a bus from Los Arcos straight to Logrogno, in Rioja. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5, ride: 10 km ↙&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2023</description>

            <description>this seemed to be a reasonable spot to stand (I came walking up the hill a few hundred meters). There are some curves before, so cars aren&amp;#x27;t too fast but there&amp;#x27;s enough time for them to see you and room for them to stop. Also the spot was shady, which is always better than sunny :) Got picked up by a nice fella from southfrance who took me 10 min but I&amp;#x27;m sure you can get a ride though to Bastia if you have a sign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, June 2013</description>

We got lift to Pazardzhik after 1,5 hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Sruby (Hitchwiki), August 2012&lt;hr&gt;It is definitely the best place to hitch-hike in Sofia, if you are going in direction to Plovdiv or Turkey. Cars are driving slow here because of the cops, so it is very easy to get a lift.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, March 2011&lt;hr&gt;Take bus #5 until it enters the highway here at the junction (going south on the E79). Ask the driver to get out here, walk down the ramp on the E80. There you&amp;#x27;ll find some shops, cars that stop, cops, and enough space to pull out your thumb! A sign is senseless :) Good to hitch towards Plovdiv.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

It wouldn&amp;#x27;t have been possible without speaking Russian though.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, April 2015</description>

            <description>The traffic was scarce, but we actually managed to get a ride all the way to Montenegro.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Mrgnd (Hitchwiki), February 2015&lt;hr&gt;It&amp;#x27;s quite good place, it&amp;#x27;s still in the city and there is a lot of space to stop. But noone goes thru the border to Montenegro. You have to be patient.&lt;br&gt;Maybe it&amp;#x27;s better to take a bus we didn&amp;#x27;t succeed and we left from Bosna and Hercegovina by our foot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2011</description>

From here you can try to get direction for Montana, as I did. But take into account that the road goes through the mountain pass about 1550 meters high, so even though the distance is not very large, it will take more time than could be expected at first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, December 2014</description>

            <description>Local people seemed to be using the parking area in front of the store on the corner, as well as the road up ahead. Just a 2 lane road, so they&amp;#x27;ll stop in the middle of the road. It isn&amp;#x27;t too busy, so it should be fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Took me 30 mins to get a ride, but there were 2 people at the store corner, 2 girls on the stretch of road and then later a guy that went in front of me. My ride even picked up those same girls later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, November 2013</description>

            <description>I used this place for going back to Spain (Canfrank) after beautifull hiking around Ibon de Estanes. I offer between around 15:00 to 19:00 to increase the possiblity. People are coming back from hiking around that hours. And hikers are a little more kind about bringing you. Not so many people speaks English.

            <description>we got there with the microbus number 18 from the central station in Sofia. it&amp;#x27;s not a good place for hitchhiking - the main road pass through a small city. We didn&amp;#x27;t wait for a long time - just about 15minutes, but i think we had a great luck. We took this road to reach Vratsa and then Vidin. I don&amp;#x27;t advise - the main traffic to Romania pass through hiway to Bucuresti.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 2/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>

            <description>Dagestan isn&amp;#x27;t as dangerous as media tell. But hitchhiking is not tolerated... in good manner. I mean if you find a local contact, he would follow the national tradition to serve the guest as good as possible, probably driving you along the coast, inviting home for dinner etc., for free, of course. More than just a hitchhike/couchsurf experience. You have to appreciate this muslim region is very different from Russia. Anyway, you better avoid attracting excessive police attention, escpecially with non-CIS passport. There are a few road posts and numerous patrols within the city limits.&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;   ,    -.     .    -  ,       (   ),   ,    , .         ,      .   ,       ,      ,      .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2013</description>

            <description>Got a ride to Burgos pretty quickly. You need to have a large sign, because cars are a bit fast in the roundabout&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 5/5, wait: 20 min, ride: 105 km ↙&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Kiéran, July 2023&lt;hr&gt;A lot of space for cars to stop, end of Vitoria heading for Burgos at first seems very very nice, but the reality is that waiting time is quite long and there&amp;#x27;s a lot of local traffic (for example to Miranda).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;HOWEVER, my friend and I had huge luck - we stopped a car going to Guarda, Portugal, through Burgos, Valladolid and Salamanca. This was probably like winning a lotery (we were heading for Lisboa), but it happened.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Good luck!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 3/5, wait: 90 min, ride: 585 km ↙&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, July 2023&lt;hr&gt;First tried a sign with Madrid, then a sign with Burgos.

Maybe just bad luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Pabple (Hitchwiki), September 2016&lt;hr&gt;I was a bit further down the road near the pedestrian crossing.

There is way enough place for the cars to stop after the bridge and they can see you from far away.

            <description>Excellent place for going to Georgia! Waited here for a ridiculous 2min until a car took me directly to the border, from where the first car took me straight to Tbilisi. Cars are really slow here and I assess the overall hitchability as insanely great! There is public transport from Vladikavkaz but I forgot which minibuses go there. Ask people or add it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, May 2015</description>

            <description>To go from Leskovac to the south, I used this place. It&amp;#x27;s 3-4km from the city center and not so much traffic going to the highway. Basically, you just have to reach the highway (some 10km away), but most of the people wont go there. Maybe it would be better to take the road to Vlasotince and get off at the intersection with the highway&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2011</description>

            <description>if you’re going towards montana/vidin, this seems to be by far the best spot for hitchhiking in the area (got dropped off there by an experienced fellow hitchhiker) and eventually got a my first longer lift of the day. there’s also a restaurant and a shelter and forest surrounding and you could comfortably spend the night there.

I walked, but it&amp;#x27;s far from the centre, so maybe a bus is better. Used a sign for Ribadeo and got a lift in 30min. Might be better from after motorway.

            <description>Don’t get dropped off here it’s very dangerous! I was there in summer and there is no shade, no water, no store or bus. People are going faster than 100 km/h so it’s difficult for them to stop. I almost collapsed because of the heat and it is very far to walk to the next town/village. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 1/5, wait: 240 min, ride: 64 km ↘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous, September 2023</description>

I exited the car of my host and lit up a smoke and within 2 minutes an unmarked police car stopped me and demanded my papers, after asking for their ID they told me the only ID I needed to see was there gun before eventually showing something real. They got me to unload the entirety of my bag and found an empty weed grinder and then tried to charge me 500 euros, they then forcefully took my passport and because I wouldn&amp;#x27;t pay they took me to the station. They then lied to me for over an hour about not being allowed to contact the embassy or a lawyer and instead made jokes about how they were conning me and I&amp;#x27;m lucky they don&amp;#x27;t send me to prison even after I had paid 450 euros for smoking a cigarette. Absolute joke. Be very careful the police force seems very corrupt as it was the chief who eventually charged me and denied me any of my rights. They are just stealing passports and holding travellers to ransom.

Hitching with no sign got me picked up to Stara Zagora in 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―HolyDrinker (Hitchwiki), July 2016&lt;hr&gt;I made a sign that said İstanbul/Свиленград and it took me about 40 minutes to find someone (I was trying to find a truck driver). If you want you can try and hitchhike a couple kilometers south to one of the truck stops (check Google Maps as I don&amp;#x27;t know the exact locations) where you will probably find a helpful trucker. Just after the gas station there is a spot for cars to pull over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are walking here, try to not get (your shoes) too dirty from the mud and sand next to the road, as there is no sidewalk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Lopotour2 (Hitchwiki), April 2014&lt;hr&gt;gateway to South Bulgaria. There is a gas staion here and enough room for cars to pull over. You have to walk to here from the town(25-30min).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;rating: 4/5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;―Anonymous</description>
